  "description": "(Including the previous Types 1* and 1**.) A fox (hare, rabbit, coyote, jackal) lies in the road pretending to be dead. A fisherman throws him on his wagon which is full of fish (cheese, butter, meat, bread, money). The fox throws the fish out of the wagon [K371.1] and jumps down after them [K341.2, K341.2.1]. A wolf (bear, fox, coyote, hyena) tries to imitate this and pretends to be dead, too. The fisherman catches him and beats him [K1026]. Cf. Types 56A, 56B, and 56A*. In some variants one animal (rabbit, fox) pretends to be dead in order to distract a man who is carrying a basket of food. Another animal (fox, wolf) steals the basket. (Previously Type 1*, cf. Type 223.) Or an animal makes a hole in the basket so that the contents fall out. (Previously Type 1**.)",

In order to convince the bear that all the grain tastes the same, the fox secretly takes a spoonful from the bear ’s dish and pretends it is from his own [K471]. (Previously Type 9C.) In some variants the animals have a race to determine who gets which part of the harvest. Cf. Types 275A–C.",

The fox pretends that he has been in vited to be godfather at a baptism (invited to a funeral or wed ding) but instead he secretly eats up the butter (honey) that he and the wolf have stored. This happens again (three times). When the wolf asks him the name of the baptized child, the fox makes up names that reflect the diminution of the stored food [K372]. When the wolf discovers the butter is missing he accuses the fox, who denies having taken it. The fox proposes a test to de ter mine who took the butter: both of them will lie in the sun and after some time the butter will melt and appear. While the wolf sleeps, the fox smears butter on him and thus “proves” his guilt [K401.1].",

After the fox has eaten all of the children, he leaves [K931]. In north European variants the mother bear requires that the applicants sing well, and thus chooses the fox. In a few variants the fox and the goose raise their children to gether and take turns minding them. The fox eats the goslings. (2) The applicants must sing to prove that they would be good hired mourners. While the mourning husband organizes the burial, the fox eats the corpse. (3) Instead of a nursemaid, a shepherd is needed for a herd of sheep. One after another, the sheep are eaten by the fox [K934]. (Previously Type 37*.) Cf. Type 123B.",

The lion notices that the organ is missing, but the fox claims that this donkey never had a heart, because if he had one, he would not have let himself be deceived [K402.3]. In variants from central Asia, a wolf, a bear, and a fox catch a camel who lets himself be eaten. While the bear and the wolf clean (butcher, transport) the carcass, the fox eats the heart (brains, in testines). He tells the wolf that the bear ate it.

He asks the bird to close its eyes as his father had always done (the fox comes near the bird, pretending that he cannot understand it). The fox grabs the bird [K721, K815.1]. Cf. Type 56D. In many variants, the bird, caught in the fox’s mouth, induces him to speak, e.g. to say grace before he eats or to tell someone what he has caught. When the fox opens his mouth, the bird escapes [K561.1]. Cf. Types 6, 122A, 122B*, 227, and 227*.",

In order to lure the rooster, the fox announces that it has been decreed that all animals are united in peace. The rooster is dubious. The rooster tells the fox that two dogs are coming their way and that maybe they are bringing along the proclamation of peace. The fox is about to run away, and the rooster asks why. The fox says that he is not sure whether the dogs know about the treaty [J1421, K579.8, K815.1.1]. In some variants the fox offers the bird a kiss to celebrate the peace treaty, and promises to close his eyes if the bird is afraid. The bird comes near the fox’s mouth and is eaten. Or, the fox offers to pray along with the rooster. The rooster wants to wait until the Imam, who is a dog, arrives. The fox runs away, claiming he forgot to wash in preparation for prayer.",

The widow rejects the first suitors who come to her because none of them has nine tails, as her husband had. Finally a suitor comes who has nine tails, and the widow agrees to marry him. The old fox who was supposed to be dead comes to the wedding [N681]. He beats his wife and her suitor and sends them out of the house [T211.6]. (2) An old fox is truly dead. One after another, the wolf, dog, stag, hare, bear, and lion (other wild animals) come to woo the widow. Only the young fox has a red coat and a pointed snout, so it is he whom she marries. (3) In Hungarian variants an old widower marries a she-fox, and they invite other foxes to their wedding. The widower pre tends to be sick and asks for an axe to put under his pillow. Believing her groom is dead, the bride invites more and more guests. A hare notices that the husband is alive but is unable to warn the others. The old widower catches them, kills them, and skins them. Cf. Type 1360C.",

The mouse begs for its freedom and promises to come to the rescue of the lion in the future. The lion laughs but sets the mouse free. Later, when the lion is caught in a net (pit, or tied with a rope), the mouse comes and gnaws him free (fills the hole with sand) [B371.1, B363, B437.2]. (2) A mouse (rat) runs under a net where a cat is also caught. When the danger is past, the mouse gnaws the net to free the cat out of gratitude that the cat did not eat him. The mouse says he regrets that a longer friendship between the two of them will not be pos si ble [J426, cf. B545.1]. (3) A lion asks a mouse to rescue him from a net. In return, the mouse asks to marry the lion’s daughter. The lion at first refuses but then agrees to the marriage. The lioness (accidentally) treads on the mouse. Cf. Type 233B.",

In summer, when it is sunny, the hare is too lazy and tells himself that last winter he went without a house [A2233.2.1]. Or, a dog curls up tight as he shivers in the winter. He prom ises himself to build a little hut during the summer. When summer comes, he discovers that he stretches out so long, he would need a big house. This would be too much work for him, so he builds no house at all. Cf. Type 43.",

The donkey is thrown into a bush where he falls on a rabbit and kills it. After that the donkey boasts about his abili ties (previously Type 125C*). Cf. Type 1051 (with human actors).

  "description": "(Including the previous Type 160B*.) A man in anger calls his horse “bear-food”. A bear comes and threatens to eat the horse [C25]. A fox agrees to help the man against the bear in return for geese. The fox goes into the forest and imitates the barking of dogs. The bear is intimidated and killed. The man pretends to go for the geese but instead brings dogs back in his bag [K235]. The dogs chase the fox to his hole. Here the fox asks his feet, eyes, ears, and tail how they helped him in his flight. His tail admits that it did not help. As a punishment the fox sticks out his tail and is attacked by dogs [J2351.1]. In some variants a hare asks his members about their help in his flight [U242.1]. (Previously Type 160B*.)",

When they meet an old man, the fox says this was a man but is no longer one. Then they see an armed hunter. The wolf approaches, but the man shots and stabs him with a sabre. Later the wolf tells the fox he could have defeated the man if he did not spit fire and attack him with a sharp rib [J17, J32].",

  "description": "A youth acquires (e.g. by exchange) three won derful dogs [B421, B312.2]. He comes to a town where people are mourning and learns that once a year a (seven-headed) dragon [B11.2.3.1] demands a virgin as a sacrifice [B11.10, S262]. In the current year, the king’s daughter has been chosen to be sacrificed, and the king offers her as a prize to her rescuer [T68.1]. The youth goes to the appointed place. While waiting to fight with the dr agon, he falls into a magic sleep [D1975], during which the princess twists a ring (ribbons) into his hair; only one of her falling tears can awaken him [D1978. 2]. Together with his dogs, the youth overcomes the dragon [B11.11, B524.1.1, R111.1.3]. He strikes off the dragon’s heads and cuts out the tongues (keeps the teeth) [H105.1]. The youth promises the princess to come back in one year (three years) and goes off. An impostor (e.g. the coachman) takes the dragon’s heads, forces the princess to name him as her rescuer [K1933], and claims her as his reward [K1932]. The princess asks her father to delay the wed ding. Just as the princess is about to marry the impostor, the dragon-slayer returns. He sends his dogs to get some food from the king’s table and is summoned to the wedding party [H151.2]. There the dragonslayer proves he was the rescuer by showing the dragon’s tongues (teeth) [H83, H105.1]. The impostor is condemned to death, and the dragon-slayer marries the princess. Cf. Types 301, 303, 314, 315, 502, 530, 554.",

After having eaten a (three) fish, the daughter of a tsar, her maid, and a she-dog (cow, mare, cat) give birth to sons at the same time [T511. 5.1]. (Cf. Type 303.) The three sons together go out for adventure [F601]. While his brothers are sleeping, the animal son [B631] (often a fool) fights against a three-headed dragon [B11.2.3.2] on a bridge. In the following two nights he defeats six[B11.2.3.3], twelve[B11.2. 3.5] or multi-headed [B11.2.3, B11.11] dragons (is able to defeat the third one only with the help of his horse [B401]). (In the form of a fly [D185.3], cat [D142] or the like,) the animal son overhears the con versations of the dragon-wives (dragon-daughters) [N451], defeats their enchantments, and thus saves his brothers. The dragon’s mother pursues the three brothers and devours two of them [B11.10. 3]. The animal son hides in a magic forge. He outwits the dragon’s mother, who spits out the brothers she had devoured. Together with the smiths, the animal son kills the dragon’s mother, and the smiths forge her to a horse. Cf. Type 705A. In some cases, a magical old man (father of the slain dragons) defeats the animal son in a contest (horse race) and takes away his horse. The old man sends out a hero in order to win a bride (often a transition to Type 513A). In addition to this regular form, there exist two versions without the introductory part of the magic conception: (1) The dragon-slayer wins back the celestial lights which the dragon had stolen and gives them to men. (Previously Type 300A*.) Cf. Type 328A*. (2) The animal son defeats the strongest dragon and wins his horse for the tsar.",

This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part: Introductory episodes: (1) A king banishes his three daughters to the underworld (they are abducted by monsters [H1385.1]). Three brothers (a supernatural hero with his extraordinary companions) go to find the daughters. (2) A monster (dragon, snake, etc.) steals golden apples from the king’s garden. Three brothers (princes) lie in wait. Only the youn gest is able to wound the monster. The brothers follow his bloody tracks [F102.1, N773]. (3) A child of magic birth (son of a bear or horse [B631], born from tears) grows into a youth gifted with exceptional strength [T615]. He takes to the road for adventure (luck), and allies himself with two companions with extraordinary powers [F601]. When they prepare their food, twice a little man (dwarf, devil, giant) spoils it (eats the food and beats up the cook) [F451.5.2]. Only the hero is able to catch and punish the little man, who then shows the companions the entrance to the underworld. Main part: The companions (brothers) come to a well (pit, cave) [F92] and lower the hero (youngest brother) into it [F96]. The hero overcomes monsters (dragons, devils) and rescues (the three) princesses (with the princesses’ help, using a weapon, only by his strength, by magic means) [R111.2.1]. (The princesses give him presents.) His treacherous companions pull the princesses up but leave the hero below [K1931.2] (cut off the rope [K963], overturn the basket). They force the maidens to name them as their rescuers [K1933]. The hero returns to the upper world with the help of a spirit, which gives him the ability to fly (a bird to whom he has to feed his own flesh [B322.1]; he ascends on a climbing plant which he himself planted, etc.). The princesses delay their wedding (for a year). On the wedding day, the hero comes to the castle and is imprisoned. But the truth comes to light (the hero is recognized by the princesses when he shows the presents [H80]), and the impostors are punished (banished, killed) [Q262]. The hero marries the youngest princess [L161] and becomes king. Cf. Type 300. In some variants, the hero has to go to much deeper regions of the underworld before he is able to come back to the upper world, because he mistakenly mounted a black animal (ram, sheep, goat, horse, lion, snake) instead of a white one. Finally the white animal carries him up again.",

A soldier takes a ship and goes out to search for the princess. On a lonely island he meets a dragon (giant, devil), makes him drunk with wine, cuts off his head and takes away his keys [B11.11]. He finds the princess and takes her to the ship. Just when they are about to sail, the princess asks for a ring she forgot, and the soldier goes back to get it. Meanwhile the ship sails away and the treacherous captain forces the princess to name him as her rescuer [K1933]. The soldier takes service with robbers (devils, magician) and finds magic objects in a forbidden room of their house [C611] (castle) (gets them as payment). With the help of these objects he gets back home. On her wedding day with the captain, the princess recognizes the soldier by her ring [H94], tells her father the truth, and marries the soldier [L161]. Cf. Types 301, 505.",

Type 554. He goes to rescue a princess who has been abducted by an ogre (giant, dragon, devil) (to rescue his wife who has been abducted by a supernatural enemy, cf. Type 400) [R11.1]. As an eagle, the youth comes to the ogre’s castle, as an ant into the princess’s chamber [D152.2, D182.2]. He learns from the princess that the ogre cannot be defeated because his heart (power of life, soul) is hidden outside of his body [E710]. The princess elicits the hiding place from the ogre [K975.2]: His heart lies – enclosed in various animals – in an egg (little box) [E711.1, E713]; cf. Type 590.

An old man (his father, God) gives the son a sword (knife) which he should always carry with him (should not lay it on the ground, not pull out from its sheath). Or: The youngest of three brothers inherits a horse, clothes, and a sabre from his father, and goes out for adventure, accompanied by some companions (blood-brothers) with magic powers [F601]. With the aid of his sword he defeats the king’s army and kills a dragon(s). His companions marry the rescued women. The youth himself marries a woman of extraordinary beauty. When the king catches a sight of her picture [T11.2] or of a curl (ring, slipper) which she lost in the sea (river), he falls in love with her and sends out an old woman (witch) to capture her. By a trick the old woman enters the youth’s house, learns the secret of the sword [E711.10], and throws it into the sea. Deprived of his strength, the youth dies, and his wife is taken to the king. Through a life token, the youth’s friends discover what has happened, recover the sword, restore it to its original condition, and resuscitate the youth. The youth creeps into the king’s castle, hides in the room of his wife, kills the king (the old woman), and becomes king himself. Cf. Type 318.",

Visiting his brothers-in-law, he learns that they are the masters of the three kingdoms of animals. The prince wins a wife who forbids him to enter a certain room [C611]. He disregards her prohibition and revives a dragon (demon) who is impaled on a wall (contained in a hoop). The dragon frees himself and abducts the prince’s wife. The prince searches for her and three times tries to flee with her. Riding on his magic horse, the dragon overtakes the two but does not kill the prince, because he promised to spare his life three times; the fourth time, he cuts him up. Signals of distress tell the brothers-in-law that the prince is in danger, and they come and resuscitate him. He goes back to the dragon, asks his wife to find out where the magic horse came from, and learns that a certain witch owns one. On his way to the witch, the prince wins the gratitude of three animals which help him to tend the witch’s three horses (daughters) that live in the earth, the clouds, and the sea. In payment, the prince chooses a scabby foal which turns into a magic horse (with extra legs), and he and his wife flee on his back. The magic horse is the brother of the dragon’s horse, and it compels the latter to throw off its rider, the dragon. The dragon is killed, and the prince returns home together with his wife. Cf.

  "title": "The Twins Or Blood-Brothers",
  "description": "(Including the previous Types 553 and 581.) After having eaten a magic fish (apple, water) [T511.5.1, T511.1.1, T512], a woman gives birth to twins. (Cf. Type 705A.) Grateful animals accompany the grown-up brothers, or animals give them one or more of their young ones because the brothers did not kill them. (The brothers are given unusual animals; they win them or bring them up; in some variants, the animals are born at the same time as the brothers [T589.7.1].) Together with his animals, one of the brothers sets out. When the brothers separate, they agree upon a life token that gives a warning when one of them is in mortal danger and needs help: Water will become cloudy, a plant or a tree dry up, a knife stuck in a tree will grow rusty, etc. [E761]. The first brother frees a princess (three princesses) from a dragon (trolls), unmasks an impostor (“Red Knight”) who pretended to be the princess’s rescuer, and marries the princess [R111.1.3, K1932, H83, L161]. Cf. Type 300. Against a warning, the hero follows a light [G451] (is tempted by an animal). He falls into the power of a witch and is turned to stone [D231]. His twin brother is warned by the life token and sets forth in quest of him. The princess mistakes him for her husband, as the two brothers are very much alike [K1311.1]. At night the brother puts a naked sword in the bed between himself and his sister-in-law [T351]. Then he finds the witch, makes her remove the spell from his brother, and kills her. The first brother learns that the second has slept with his wife and kills him out of jealousy [N342.3]. Later on, when he asks his wife why she had put the sword in the bed, he realizes that his brother was innocent. The brother is resuscitated by magic means [B512] (water of life). In some variants, a youth saves the life of a raven (crane, eagle). As a reward he obtains magic objects. The youth defeats a sea monster, delivers three princesses, and marries the youngest of them.

Often he cuts off their tongues (heads, other parts of the body) which he takes away as trophies [H83]. Cf. Type 300. In the castle, the youth comes to a room where a princess lies sleeping [N711.2]. He looks at her (falls in love, kisses her, rapes her) and, before leaving, takes a souvenir (jewelry, handkerchief, shoes, etc.) which later becomes a token [H81.1, H81.1.1, T475.2]; cf. Types 301, 301D*. Then he returns with a burning log (lets time resume) and kindles the fire again. An impostor pretends that he had killed the giants and claims the (pregnant) princess for his wife. The princess refuses to marry him. She sets up (is made to live in) an inn [Q481] where guests need not pay anything if they tell a tale (life-history, news). (Accompanied by his brothers and mother,) the youth stops at this inn, proves his identity by means of his tale and the tokens, and marries the princess [H11.1.1, H81, L161]. The impostor is punished.",

  "description": "1.7.3.3]. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms (cf. Types 314, 551, 673): (1) A king falls ill and learns that he can only be cured by the milk and blood of a dragon’s heart. He promises his oldest daughter to whoever is able to get the remedy, and his youngest daughter to whoever assists. A nobleman and a farmer boy set out and, with the help of an old woman, arrive at the dragon’s forest. The farmer boy kills the dragon, squeezes milk and blood out of its heart, and hides them. Threatening to kill him, the nobleman takes the dragon’s heart, presents it to the king and wins the eldest daughter and the kingdom [K1935]. The farmer boy and the youngest daughter are sent to live in the goose house. Because there were neither milk nor blood in the dragon’s heart, the nobleman, the farmer boy, and the old woman are questioned. Truth comes to light, and the kingdom goes to the farmer boy. (2) During his travels, a workman learns that the sick king can only be cured by a dragon’s liver. He sees the dragon’s vulnerable spot in a dream. He kills the dragon and boasts of his victory in an inn. The host steals the man’s knapsack which, however, contains only a stone. The workman arrives at the king’s court prior to the host, cures the king, and wins the princess as his wife. The thievish host is hanged. (3) A father orders his son to bring him the devil’s tongue to cure his illness, but the son cannot find the devil. An old man advises him to knock with a stick on a certain trunk. A horse appears and carries him to the devil. The horse gives the son a piece of his hoof which he can use to call it whenever he is in danger. The son challenges the devil, but, during the fight, the devil thrusts him into the earth up to his waist. With the help of the horse, the son defeats the devil, brings the devil’s tongue to his father, and thus cures him. (4) While hunting, a prince is bewitched and loses his voice. A young woman appears in his dream and tells him about a remedy: a medicine consisting of dragons’ eyes, a dragon’s heart and other ingredients, which must be prepared in a certain manner. In return the young woman demands that the prince marry her. After the prince agrees, a youth appears and produces the medicine in the prescribed way. The cure is successful, and the prince marries the young woman.",

A youth (soldier, Gypsy, tailor, shepherd, farmer, etc.) acquires a magic object (e.g. shoes, cap, overcoat, stick) which makes him invisible [D1980]. He refuses a narcotic drink and does not fall asleep [K625.1]. After making himself invisible, the youth accom panies the princess on a magical underground journey [D2131]. In the under world he watches the princess wear out her shoes by dancing with the devil (dragon, other supernatural beings) [F1015. 1.1]. The next morning the youth tells the king what happened and cor roborates his tale by tokens (e.g. twigs, apples, ring, piece of the prin cess’s garment) from the underworld [H80].

During the third night, when the girl leaves the coffin, the soldier lies down in it, refuses to let her in, and forces her (by means of a rusty sword) to say a Paternoster (sing a hymn at the altar).

The youngest sister pretends to marry the demon and leaves a skull (straw dummy) dressed as a bride to deceive him. Unwit tingly the demon carries this sister home in the third basket. Or she smears herself with honey and feathers and escapes as a “strange bird” [K525, K521.1]. Cf. Types 1383, 1681. The demon is burned in his own house or is killed in another way [Q211]. Cf.

Thereupon the girl in the bag starts singing her tale: I left my rosary on a stone by the river when I was washing. When I wanted to get it, a Gypsy put me in his bag and carried me off. (I am the only daughter of an old couple. An old man carried me off when I was gathering berries in the forest.) One day the Gypsy arrives at the old washerwoman’s house. The woman recognizes her niece, invites the Gypsy into his house, and entertains him until he gets drunk. When he is sleeping, she rescues the girl from the bag and, in her place, puts two cats (horse-dung). When the Gypsy exhibits his singing bag the next time, the cats mew. The Gypsy opens the bag and is scratched or bitten [K526].",

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 313A, 313B, 313C, and 313H*.) This type combines various introductory episodes with the two main parts of the “Magic Flight” and the “Forgotten Fiancée”. Introductory episodes: (1) After a war between birds and quadrupeds [B261, cf. Type 222], a wounded eagle is cared for by a man. The eagle (its relatives) gives the man a box which he must not open before he arrives at home. The man disobeys and a castle appears. An giant helps the man close the box and, in return, is promised the man’s unborn son [S222]. Cf. Type 537. In some variants, a boy is promised to a demon, giant, or devil [S222, S240], or the boy promises himself to the demon. Threat ening him with death, the demon (giant, devil) assigns the youth (often three) impossible tasks [G465] (e.g. building a castle in one night [H1104], bailing out a pond with a sieve [H1113], felling a forest using an axe of glass, capturing a magic horse [H1154.8]) which he performs with the help of the demon’s daughter [H335.0.1]. Before the youth can marry the daughter, he must identify her in a group of women (her sisters) who look just like her. (2) A youth watches girls (transformed swans) bathing in a lake and steals the swan dress of one of them [D361.1, D721]. The girl agrees to marry the youth and takes him to her father ’s house. Cf. Types 400, 465A. (3) A king suffering from leprosy (scabs) captures a prince and feeds him with sweets for forty days, in the hope that the prince’s blood will cure his sickness. The princess falls in love with the foreign youth. Main parts: Magic Flight. The daughter of the demon (king) uses her magical power to flee together with the youth. She leaves magic speaking objects (spittle, blood) behind to deceive her father [D1611]. Nevertheless the flight is discovered and the father follows them. In order to escape, the girl transforms herself and her fiancé into various things or persons (e.g. into rose and thornbush, church and priest, lake and duck) [D671], or she throws magic objects (comb, brush, mirror, etc.) which become obstacles in the way of the pursuer [D672]. After the third transformation, the pursuer has to give up (dies). Cf. Type 310. In some variants of the Magic Flight two children (brother and sister) flee from a witch (demon, dragon, ogre, witch, wolf, bad stepmother). (Previously Type 313H*.) Forgotten Fiancée [D2003]. The youth goes to visit his home and leaves his bride behind. At home he breaks a taboo: Disobeying the bride’s warning, he kisses someone (eats something) and thus for gets his experiences [D2004.2, C234, D2004.3]. When the youth is about to marry another woman, the forgotten fiancée reawakens his memory by performing magic actions (paralyses three lovers in embarrassing positions [D2006.1.1], magically stops the wedding carriage of the new bride [D2006.1.5], brings a couple of birds who remind the youth of her help [D2006.1.3], or buys a place for three nights in the bridal bed from her husband’s new bride, and in the third night successfully reawakens his memory [D1978.4, D2006. 1.4], etc.). The youth marries the true bride.",

When the appointed time comes, the son learns about his father ’s promise and flees. On the way the youth divides the carcass of an animal among a lion, a falcon, and an ant (other animals) by taking the animals’ characteristics into consideration. In return he receives from the grateful animals the power to transform himself into their shapes. Using this power he wins a princess as his wife. After winning a battle (while hunting) the youth comes near the water and is seized and pulled down (swallowed) by the water nix [F420.5.2.2]. By offering precious objects (three golden apples), his wife tempts the nix to the surface. In exchange for these objects the water nix exhibits her husband: first up to his head, then up to his waist. When the water nix exhibits the husband’s whole body, he changes into a bird and escapes [R152, D642.2].",

The king promises her as a wife to whoever can bring her back. In some variants, the king promises his daughter to whoever brings him healing fruits from the tree. After noble canditates have failed, a young swineherd succeeds in climbing the tree wearing iron boots [Q502.2]. In the upper world the youth guards the dragon’s magic horse which tells him (he asks the princess to find out) where the dragon’s power is hidden. The youth kills the dragon, returns to earth together with the princess, and marries her. In some variants, in the upper world the youth watches over the magic horses of a fairy (Tündér Ilona) who gives him clothes of copper, silver, and gold. The fairy falls in love and marries the youth. The youth enters a forbidden chamber [C611] and frees a dragon which carries off the fairy. Continuation as in Type 302C*.",

  "description": "(Including the previous Type 590A.) Introduction: Two brothers live together. The younger works for the elder, who is married. The wife attempts to seduce the younger brother but he refuses her. She complains to her husband that her brother-in-law attacked her [K2111]. The youth flees from his angry brother. In some variants, this part continues as follows: The fugitive is caught and castrated. After this he lives in a foreign city. A princess falls in love with him and marries him in spite of his mutilation. When the king learns of his son-in-law’s defect, the latter has to flee. He is cured by a supernatural being and is able to return to his wife. Main part: A youth acquires magic objects, among them a magic gift (rusty sword, shirt that imparts strength) from a serpent which he rescued (by theft, by other means). Using these objects, he helps a king to be victorious and, in return, marries a princess. The princess has a lover [T232]. She persuades her husband to give her the magic objects (exchanges them) [K2213]. The husband is killed and, as he had requested, his dismembered body is loaded on his horse and carried to the serpent’s castle. The dead youth is resuscitated (by the serpent) and given the power of self-transformation. As a horse with a golden mane he is sold to the king. The princess recognizes the horse as her former husband and orders that it be killed. (On his advice) a maidservant catches drops of its blood which turn into a tree with golden apples. The princess recognizes the tree as her former husband, and orders that it be felled. (On his advice) the maidservant throws a chip into a pond, where it turns into a golden drake [D610]. The lover, leaving the sword and shirt behind, tries to catch the drake. The drake becomes a man and uses his magic power to kill his rival and his treacherous wife. He marries the maidservant.",

The youth secretly learns how to practice magic and flees, or his father identifies him among a flock of identical doves (other birds) with the help of tokens which the son (an old man) had given to him. The son is released. The father sells the youth successively as a greyhound, an ox, and a horse, but the son tells him not to sell the things that bind them (leash, yoke, bridle). Thus father and son become wealthy [D612, K252]. But at last the youth as a horse returns to the magi cian’s influence because, contrary to instructions, the father let the magician take the bridle. So the youth loses his power and is tor mented by the magician [C837]. Finally the youth succeeds in removing the bridle. He conquers the magician in a transformation combat (they change themselves into hare, fish, bird, etc.) and escapes [D722, D615.2]. At last, transformed into a ring (apple, etc.), he falls into a princess’s lap. When the magician asks for the ring, the princess throws it away and grains of corn fall on the ground. The magician as a rooster is about to eat the corn, but the youth becomes a fox and bites off the rooster ’s head [L142.2]. He marries the princess.",

He would kill them in the night, but the smart young est brother saves them by exchanging their caps with those of the ogre’s daughters. (Cf. Types 327B, 1119.) The brothers take service at the king’s court.

Using tricks the youth gets these objects. Cf. Types 1525, 1525A. At last the brothers claim that the youngest can kidnap the ogre himself [H1172]. In disguise the youth tells the ogre that the thief died and persuades him to lie down in the coffin to measure it [G514.1]. The youth nails up the coffin, traps the ogre, and is given a princess as his wife. In some variants, the youth sets out to steal from the ogre in order to get revenge for former ill-treatment [G610.1] or to help a friendly king [G610.3]. In some variants, mainly from northern and north-western Europe and the Americas, the protagonist is female.",

One of the beans grows into a giant beanstalk [F54.2], which Jack climbs to an upper world where he finds the house of a giant. The giant’s wife gives him food and hides him when her hus band comes home. The giant smells human flesh [G84] but his wife tells him he is mistaken [G532]. The giant eats dinner, counts his money, and then falls asleep. Jack steals the money and runs home down the beanstalk. He makes two more trips, stealing the giant’s hen that lays golden eggs [B103.2.1] and his self-playing harp [D1601.18]. The third time, the harp cries out and awakens the giant, who runs after Jack. Jack reaches the bottom of the beanstalk and chops it down. The giant falls to his death, and Jack and his mother have plenty of money.",

  "description": "(Bonhomme Misère.) (Including the previous Types 330A–D and 330*.) A smith, who because of poverty (other reasons) sold his soul to the devil (death) [M211], gives shelter to Christ and St. Peter during their visit on earth [K1811]. In reward, three of his wishes shall be fulfilled [Q115] (cf. Type 750A). St. Peter warns him to wish for a place in paradise, but the smith wants a tree and a bench (chair) to which people stick and a knapsack that draws people into it [J2071, D1413.1, D1413.5, D1412.1] (a pack of cards with which he shall al ways win [N221], etc.). Cf. Type 753A. When the devil (death) is about to carry the smith away, he sticks to the bench and the tree and has to give the smith more time to live (terminate the contract), or no one would be able to die [Z111.2]. At last the devil is put into the sack and beaten up (on the anvil) [K213]. The smith, tired of life, cannot go either to heaven or to hell [Q565]. He tricks St. Peter by pushing his knapsack into heaven, where it pulls him in [K2371.1.3] (throws his cards inside the gate of heaven and is permitted inside to pick them up). In some variants the trickster-protagonist is an allegorical figure (e.g. Misery, Envy, Poverty) who traps the devil in a tree until the devil promises him immortality. Then he sets the devil free.

  "description": "This tale exists in two different forms: (1) An old soldier becomes the doorkeeper for heaven. Death asks him several times whom he should take next. God wants death to take the old people (then people in the middle of their life, then young people in succession). However, the doorkeeper wants to save his parents (wife, children), so he tells death instead to fell firs (beechtrees, oaks). God discovers this deception and shows death whom he should take next. Thus the soldier and his relatives are reunited in heaven. (In some variants, the soldier is banished to hell. Here he delivers a number of souls from purgatory and is chased away. Cf. Type 475.) (2) A prince wants to gain immortality. He travels through three different kingdoms, in which the rulers have to perform tasks which must be finished within 600 (800, 1000) years (pulling out a tree, carrying off a mountain, wearing out thousands of sewing needles). During this time death has lost his power. Each time the prince is given magic objects and asked to stay, but he travels on. Finally he arrives at the empire of immortality. After a thousand years he goes to look for his parents. The queen of immortality gives him water of life which he uses to resuscitate the deceased rulers of the three kingdoms. The prince, finding no trace of his former home and family, returns. Pursued by death, he reaches the border of the empire of immortality. In a contest with death, the queen of immortality wins the prince and they live to gether forever.",

  "description": "(Petit Chaperon Rouge, Cappuccetto rosso, Rotkäppchen.) (Including the previous Type 333A.) A little girl, called “Red Riding Hood” because of her red cap, is sent to her grandmother who lives in the forest and is warned not to leave the path [J21.5]. On the way she meets a wolf. The wolf learns where the girl is going, hurries on ahead, and devours the grandmother (puts her blood in a glass and her flesh in a pot). He puts on her clothes and lies down in her bed. Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmother ’s house. (She has to drink the blood, eat the flesh, and lie down in the bed.) Red Riding Hood doubts whether the wolf is her grandmother and asks him about his odd big ears [Z18.1], eyes, hands, and mouth. Finally the wolf eats Red Riding Hood [K2011]. A hunter kills the wolf and cuts open his belly. Red Riding Hood and the grandmother are rescued alive [F913]. They fill the wolf ’s belly with stones [Q426]; he is drowned or falls to his death. Cf. Types 123, 2028. In some variants Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmother ’s house before the wolf. The wolf climbs on the roof to wait until Red Riding Hood leaves. The Grandmother who had boiled sausages asks Red Riding Hood to fill the broth into a big trough in front of the house. Enticed by the smell, the wolf falls from the roof and is drowned in the trough. In an Italian version, a woman who is going to bake cakes sends out her daughter (Caterinella, Caterina, Cattarinetta) to borrow a pan. The lender, an ogre (witch, wolf), asks the girl to bring back some cakes and wine. On her way she eats the cakes, drinks the wine, and replaces them with horse-dung and urine. Angry about the trick, the ogre pursues the girl home and devours her (is not able to get into the house, is tricked out by the girl’s mother). (Previously Type 333A.)",

This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A man in distress (impoverished fisherman, merchant) un wittingly promises his (unborn) son to the devil [S240]. When the boy is delivered to him later, the devil cannot use him because he is protected by magic [K218.2] (cf. Type 810). Thus the boy is cast out in the sea (river, desert). He arrives in a foreign country and finds a lonely castle where he meets a bewitched princess (maiden, fairy) in the form of a serpent (deer). He rescues her by enduring three nights of torture [D758.1]. They marry [F302, L161]. When he wants to visit his parents, his wife gives him a ring to carry him home [D1470.1.15], and she forbids him to call her to come to him [C31.6] (to boast of her beauty [C31.5]). At home he is in duced (by his mother) to break the taboo. His wife appears [D2074. 2.3.1], takes the ring, and leaves him destitute. The man sets out in search of his wife [H1385.3]. On his way he meets three hermits (rulers of animal kingdoms, or moon, sun, and wind) whom he asks for directions [B221, H1232, H1235]. With the help of the third he arrives at the empire of his wife, or he pretends that he wants to help three giants who are fighting over magic ob jects (inheritance, booty). He steals the magic objects (magic sword [D1400.1.4], magic coat or hood [D1361.14], seven-league boots [D1521.1]) [D831, D832] (cf. Type 518). With their help he is able to overcome the obstacles on the way to his wife [D2121]. When he finds his wife, she is about to marry another man [N681]. He discloses his identity as her real husband. (2) Meeting the princess and disenchantment as in version (1); but the disenchantment is not complete. The princess wants to travel back to her own distant land. She asks her rescuer to wait for her at a certain time and place. She ap pears three times, but each time a servant (witch) has put her hus band into a deep sleep from which he cannot be awakened [D1364.15, D1364.4.1, D1972]. The princess informs him (in a letter) how and where to find her (on the glass mountain). The man sets out to find her. Continued as in version (1). (3) A youth watches a flock of birds (swans, ducks, geese, doves) land on the shore. The birds take off their feather coats and become beautiful maidens [D361.1]. While they are bathing, the youth steals the feather coat of the most beautiful girl, who cannot leave with the others and thus must marry the youth [D721.2, B652.1]. Later, because of carelessness (of the man’s mother), the maiden takes back her coat [D361.1.1] and flies away (together with her children). She tells the youth her destination in the otherworld (e.g. glass mountain). The man sets out in search of his wife (as in version 1). Some variants include elements from Type 313 (Magic Flight).",

Twelve (seven , three) soldiers (deserters) come (often with the help of an animal or person) to a lonely castle (small house), where they receive food and lodging. A white woman (maiden who appears in a dream) asks them to stay in the castle for seven years (one year and two days) (to keep guard for three nights) and to fulfill certain conditions (not to think of a maiden, not to touch or look at the maidens who sleep in their beds, not to open a certain door). They disobey the prohibition and flee, or all (but one) leave the castle before the end of the vigil. Thus their efforts to disenchant the princesses who live in the castle are unsuccessful [D759.9]. The soldiers often return later, and the one is rewarded (often after having performed different tasks), but the others are killed. In some variants the soldiers succeed in disenchanting the princesses and each of them marries one of them (seven seven-year-old boys finally break the spell) [D759.10].",

  "title": "The Animal Bride (previously The Mouse [Cat, Frog, etc",
  "description": "] as Bride). A father is not able to decide which of his (three) sons should inherit his property (kingdom) and sends them all on a quest for one year [H1210.1]. They are told to bring back a special object (yarn, linen [H1306], fine chain [H1303], ring, horse, smallest dog [H1307], money ) or they must learn a profession. Whoever performs the task best will be the heir. The youngest son, often a fool, goes into a forest and becomes the servant of an animal (cat [B422], rat, frog [B493.1], mouse [B437.2]). As a payment he is given the object that his father had asked for. It proves to be the most beautiful one, and thus he should be the heir [H1242]. Because his brothers (parents) are envious, two further tasks are set, and finally the brothers are required to bring a bride (most beautiful woman [H1301.1]). The youngest returns to the animal which again promises to help. The animal is disenchanted by burning, mutilation, decapi tation [D711], or by crossing a river [B313, D700], and becomes a beautiful princess with a castle. They return happily to his parents as bride and bridegroom. Sometimes they deceive the parents: The youngest son arrives dressed in rags and is ridiculed; then the bride arrives and they reveal their identities. When the son arrives in the first place dressed as a prince, a mole helps to identify him. Often the youngest son renounces his inheritance and goes with his wife back to her castle. In some variants from eastern and southeastern Europe and the Near East, the youngest son takes the animal (often a frog or toad) to his home and hides it from the family. The father assigns tasks to his daughters-in-law which the frog performs best. The last (third) task requires the brides to attend a feast, where the frog turns into the most beautiful woman. The bridegroom burns the frog’s skin so that the bride cannot change back. As a consequence she leaves him, and he sets out on a quest and finally is able to retrieve her. Cf. Type 400.",

On their journey to the king’s court, the stepmother or stepsister casts the true bride out of the carriage (overboard) [S432]. The king marries the ugly stepsister [K1911], and the brother is thrown into prison or a pit of snakes [Q465.1]. (The king’s wife gives birth to a child. The stepmother throws her and her child into the water and substitutes her own daughter for the bride [K1911.1.2].) The true bride is transformed to a duck (goose) [D161.2], and comes to the king’s court three times (to care for her child [D688]). The last night the king wakes and disenchants her by decapitation [D711] (cutting her golden belt, holding her during successive transformations [D712.4]). The brother, unharmed in the den of snakes [B848], is rescued. The true bride is married or reinstated, and the false bride and her mother are punished [Q261]. Cf. Types 450, 480, 510B, 511.",

A king sees the girl and wants to marry her. Her wicked stepmother (aunt) and step sister accompany her on the journey to the king’s court. On the way, the girl’s stepmother feeds her with salty food. When the girl asks for water, the stepmother puts out both of her eyes [S165] or muti lates her. They take her clothes and throw her into the sea. The step sister, posing as the bride, marries the king. A kind fisherman (poor man) finds the blinded girl, takes her home, and becomes rich from the gold from her hands. He uses the gold (jewels, flowers) to buy back the girl’s eyes [E781.2] (the snake commands this). The girl recovers her sight, dresses in beau tiful clothes, and goes to the king’s court.

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 407A, 407B, 652A, and 702B*.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A girl (woman, fairy) has been transformed into a flower (twig, bush, tree, fruit) (transforms herself) [D212]. A man (her pre destined lover) breaks a stalk and the flower changes back into a girl [D711.4] (he takes the girl in the form of a flower on a journey with him and transforms it afterwards). He marries her [T101] (some times her vegetable clothing has to be burned). Cf. Type 652. (2) After a hasty wish, a woman gives birth to a twig (bush, fruit) [T513, T555], plants it in a pot, and cares for it as for a child. A prince is irresistibly drawn to the plant and becomes love-sick [T24.1]. He obtains the plant. During the night a girl comes out of it, eats, and makes love with him. When the prince has to go to war, the girl stays in the plant. The prince attaches a bell to the plant which he will ring when he wants to call the girl. An envious woman (fiancée) signals the girl to come. She ap pears and is killed, and her plant is destroyed. A compassionate woman resuscitates the girl [E0], and the rival is punished. (Pre viously Types 407A and 652A. Because of its structural similarity, also the previous Type 702B* is integrated here.) (3) A beautiful girl wants to have a lover, even if he is the devil (a dead man) [C15]. The devil comes in the form of an attractive man (with animal feet). She follows him and sees him eating corpses in a church [G20.1]. Several times she is asked whether she had seen anything. She denies this repeatedly, even when the devil kills her sister, mother, and father. At last she herself dies. Because she had made special arrangements for her funeral, the devil cannot find her. Cf. Types 363, 1476B. From her grave grows a beautiful flower (lily, rose, tulip) [E631.1] which only her predestined husband (nobleman, prince) is able to pick. Because she has to eat, at night she becomes a beautiful woman. Her husband takes her as his wife (often on the condition that he may not talk about her or present her in public, so that the devil will not be able to find her). The couple succeeds in tricking or killing the devil (the devil takes the woman to hell). (Previously Type 407B.)",

  "description": "A prince insolently breaks an old woman’s jar (makes her angry in another way). She utters a curse: he is to fall in love with three oranges (lemons, other fruits, girls of magic origin) [S375]. The prince sets out on a (sometimes very long) quest during which he is given directions, advice, and help to overcome obstacles. The prince finds the fruits in a garden (castle). When he opens them, out of each comes a beautiful, often naked, young woman who asks for water (comb, mirror, towel, clothes, etc.) [D721.5]. The prince can give only the third woman what she asks for, and the other girls die (disappear, return into the fruits). The prince hides the woman on a tree besides a fountain while he goes to get clothes (carriage, company) for her. An ugly black woman (Gypsy woman, witch) comes to get water. She thinks that the reflection of the Orange Girl is her own [J1791.6.1], and breaks her water jar because she thinks she is too beautiful to carry water. The Orange Girl laughs, and the black woman discovers her. The black woman succeeds in taking the Orange Girl’s place (two different versions). The prince returns, and though he is aston ish ed at the sudden change (excuses: sunburn, influences of wind and weather), he marries the false bride. (1) The black woman pushes the Orange Girl into the water [K1911.2.2], where she changes into a fish [D170] (bird [D150]). The false bride demands that it be killed, but from its remains grows a tree. She demands it be felled, but an old woman (man) takes away a splinter (log) [D610]. Out of this once again comes the Orange Girl, who secretly does the old woman’s housework. The old woman finds the girl and adopts her. The prince recognizes her when he hears her life history (when the girl tends one of his horses) [K1911.3]. (2) The black woman combs (louses) the Orange Girl and sticks a magic needle into her head. The girl changes into a dove [D150] and flies to the castle. The gardener (cook) hears the bird’s song asking about the prince and his black wife. The dove is captured and the prince is much pleased with it. He finds the magic needle and removes it, and thus the dove changes back into the Orange Girl [K1911.3]. Cf. Type 452B*. After the couple’s reunion, the false bride is punished (sentenced to a cruel death; she often pronounces her own judgment).",

A fairy (wise woman) who has not been invited to the celebration (baptism) utters a curse that the princess (on her 15th birthday) will die of a wound from a spindle (needle, fiber of flax) [F361.1.1, F316, G269.4, M341.2.13]. Another fairy changes the death sentence into a long (hundred-year) sleep [F316.1]. The king orders that every spindle (needle) in his empire be destroyed; but, because one of them has been overlooked, the prophecy is fulfilled [M370]: The girl meets an old woman who is spinning in a hidden chamber, pricks her finger with the spindle, and sinks, together with the whole court, into a magic sleep [D1364. 17, D1960.3, F771.4.4, F771.4.7]. Around the castle grows a hedge of thorns [D1967.1] (the girl is enclosed in a tower). At the end of the appointed time, a youth (prince) breaks through the hedge [N711.2] and awakens the princess with a kiss [D735, D1978.5] (he impregnates her; she gives birth to two children, one of whom sucks the fiber out of her finger and thus disenchants her). In some variants the prince takes his wife and children to his family. During his absence the evil mother-in-law asks the cook to slaughter and roast the woman and the children. The cook disobeys, and the mother-in-law demands that the three be thrown into a tub full of poisonous toads and snakes.

Introductory episodes: (1) The youngest daughter asks her father (the king) to bring her a (musical) rose (lark, etc.) from his journey. He finds it in the garden of a beast, but in return has to promise his daughter (the first being he meets when he arrives at home) [L221, S228, S241] to the beast. The father tries in vain to send another girl instead of his daughter [S252]. Cf. Type 425C. (2) An animal-son (snake, crayfish, also pumpkin, etc.) is born (because of the hasty wish of his parents) [C758.1]. He demands a princess for his wife and performs difficult (impossible) tasks. The princess has to marry him [T111]. (3) A girl is intended (by fate) for an animal bridegroom or agrees to marry him [B620.1, L54.1]. (4) For other reasons a girl has an animal husband and lives to gether with him in his castle. He becomes a beautiful man by night [D621.1, B640.1]. Main part: When the young wife (often on the advice of her female rela tives) burns the animal-skin of her bridegroom [C757.1] (looks at him during the night or burns him with candle wax [C32.1, C916.1], reveals his secret [C421], or otherwise prevents his disenchantment), he goes away [C932]. The young wife sets out for a long and difficult quest [H1385.4] (in iron shoes [Q502.2], etc.). On her way she is given directions and precious gifts by the sun, moon, wind, and stars [H1232] (helpful old people or animals [H1233.1.1, H1235). She arrives (sometimes by climb ing a glass mountain [H1114]) at her bridegroom’s far-away residence. She finds that her husband has another (supernatural) bride. She takes service as maid [Q482.1] and trades her precious things (golden implements for spinning, jewels, magnificent clothes, etc.) for three nights by the side of her lost husband [D2006.1.1]. She wants to awaken his memory of her, but two times he is drugged by a sopor ific. He spills the soporific on the third night, stays awake, and recognizes her as his true bride [D2006.1.4]. (Death of the false bride.) Cf. Type 313.",

Introductory episodes: A young woman marries a supernatural bridegroom: (1) She is given to her bridegroom because of a present that she has asked her father to bring back from a journey [S228]. (2) The bridegroom performs a set of difficult tasks. (3) She pulls up an herb and discovers the bridegroom’s subterra nean castle (a wind carries her there). (4) She finds him in another way. The bridegroom is the son of a witch (ogress) or he is (during the day) an animal [D621.1]. Main part: The young woman breaks the bridegroom‘s prohibition (cf. Type 425A), and he goes away [C932]. (Before he leaves, he gives her a token, e.g. ring, feather.) (In iron shoes) she sets out to find him [H1385.4, H1125]. The bride comes to the house of her bridegroom’s mother, a witch, who swears by her son’s name not to devour her. The witch imposes difficult tasks on the young woman, which she performs (with the help of her bridegroom): to sort a large quantity of grain [H1122], to fill mattresses with the feathers of all kinds of birds, to wash the black wool white and the white black [H1023.6, cf. Type 1183], to sweep a house but leave it unswept [H1066], etc. In some variants she enchants (three) suitors and makes them fight (part of previous Type 425N). Cf. Types 313, 875. The young woman is sent on a dangerous journey to bring a casket from the sister of the witch. Having passed obstacles (with the advice from her bridegroom) and obtained the casket, she is forbidden to open it. (Cf. Types 408, 480.) When the bride acts against the prohibition, her husband helps her. At the wedding of the bridegroom and the witch’s daughter, the young woman has to hold ten burning candles (torches). Her bridegroom saves her from being burned. The young woman remarries her bridegroom, or both escape by a magic (transformation) flight [D671, D672]. In some variants a female demon (witch) demands that a young woman accomplish impossible tasks [G204, H1010, H931]. Among other things, the girl has to bring a letter to another demon telling her to kill the girl [K978] (cf. Type 930). A wolf helps the girl to es cape the danger [B435.3]. As a reward, the wolf is disenchanted. He turns to a prince [D113.1] and marries the young woman. (Pre viously Type 428.)",

Many structural similarities exist between Types 425A and 425B, and often the variants are not clearly identified as belong ing to one type or the other. The essential feature of this type is the quest for the casket, which entails the visit to the second witch’s house. Usually the super natural bridegroom is the witch’s son, and he helps his wife perform the tasks. According to Swahn (1955), the previous Type 428 is a fragment of Type 425B.",

The youngest daughter meets her father ’s obligation but refuses to marry the (ugly) animal, who treats her kindly. In a magic mirror she sees her father is ill. She is allowed to visit him but (influenced by her envious sisters) overstays the allotted time [C761.2]. She returns and finds the animal near death, realizes she loves him, and caresses or kisses him. By this means she dis enchants the prince from his animal shape [D735.1]. They marry.",

She thus learns where her husband lives and how to save him [C991]. She finds her husband and disenchants him. In some variants a princess loses her enchanted bridegroom, a bird [D150], and becomes melancholy. The king promises a reward to anyone who can make the princess laugh [H1194]. An old woman , who knows where the bridegroom lives, tells the princess and makes her laugh. The princess finds her bridegroom in his castle. She releases him from his enchantment by starving for seven years (standing without shelter out in the wind and rain for a year or more). By doing this she becomes so ugly that the prince does not want her. With the help of kind fairies she becomes beautiful and wealthy. Her bridegroom falls in love with her. She makes demand s on him (he must build a bridge and lie down in a coffin). They are reunited. (Previously Type 425F.)",

Her father insists that she must marry the first one whom she meets (whoever picks up a certain rose). A mouse with a stinking tail (a poor man carrying water) comes by, and the princess marries him [T118]. During the wedding feast, when guests insult the mouse-bridegroom, the castle and all its inhabitants disappear, and the princess finds herself alone. She sets out on a quest for her lost husband [H1385.4]. Two hermits direct her to the underworld. There she finds the castle of the mouse-bridegroom. Through her love he is disenchanted and turns into a beautiful prince [D700]. In some variants the princess lives in poverty with her husband. She dreams of a splendid castle and of wealth. Two times the dream comes true, and she invites her relatives to the castle. When her poor husband appears, someone calls his name and the castle disappears. The third time, she instructs them not to call her husband’s name. Thus he is disenchanted.",

In a foreign country he entertains the king’s court with his musical talents. He meets the king’s daughter and is charmed by her beauty. When the donkey wants to return home, the king tries to prevent him by offering him his daughter in marriage [B641.4]. On the wedding night the donkey takes off his skin and turns into a hand some prince. A servant who observes this tells the king, who burns up the skin on the following night [D721.3].

The two older girls cook and make a bed only for the man, not for the animals, nor do they wait for the old man to go to bed before they do [Q2]. He shuts them up in his cellar. The youngest girl takes care of the animals, feeds them [L54] and takes the leftovers for herself, and goes to bed only after the old man is settled down for the night. She wakes up in a palace. Instead of the old man, she finds a young prince, who, together with his three servants, had been enchanted by a witch. The girl and the prince marry [L162], and the sisters must serve as maids until they prove themselves to be sympathetic to animals. In some variants a woman spoils her lazy, bad-tempered daughter and mistreats the industrious stepsister, giving her only a little food. She follows a rolling loaf of bread to a (enchanted) house in the forest. She shares her food with animals who live there (whom she has brought with her) and is kind to an old man or an animal-man (forest spirit). On the advice of the animals, she takes the man to bed with her, and he is disenchanted (along with the animals) [D731]. She marries the man or is given a reward. The jealous sister comes to the house with good food, but does not share it with the animals, so they do not give her advice. She is unkind to the old man (spirit) and is (severely) punished. Cf.

The father at first cannot find such a thing, but then he obtains it from an unknown prince. (Cf. Types 425A, 425B, 425C, 894.) The daughter uses the present to call its owner, who comes (in bird form) through her window [D641.1]. The envious sisters (stepmother) spy and discover the lover. They put knives or broken glass around the window [K2212.1, S181]. The prince is wounded and does not visit any more. The youngest daughter (disguises herself as a man [K1837] and) goes to look for her lover [H1385.5]. She overhears a conversa tion between birds (demonic beings, who meet in or under a tree) who speak about where the prince is and how he can be cured by a medicine [N452]. The woman prepares the medicine, finds her lover, and heals him. In payment, he gives her a present (ring, hair, shirt, horse ). The prince recognizes his love. Or, back home, she summons him by means of the feather (etc.). He comes but is angry because he believes that she had injured him, and she explains what really happened. She shows him the second present (ring, shirt etc.) to prove that it was she who had cured him. They are reconciled [B642].",

She disenchants him by kissing or embracing him or by sharing his bed [D735.1], or because she wears more shirts than he has layers of skin. (Previously Types 433 and 433A.) Cf. Types 425A, 441, 480, and 711. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A poor woman gives birth to a snake (a couple adopt a snake or a frog as their child). When the animal grows up he wants to marry the daughter of the king. The king sets impossible tasks, which the snake accomplishes (the snake frightens the king). The snake marries the princess, and after the wedding he turns into a handsome man (prince). (2) A childless queen (through a hasty wish [T513] or magic conception [T510]) gives birth to an animal son (snake, dragon, etc.) whom she keeps secret. When he grows up he wants to marry, but every woman who marries him is killed on her wedding night. One courageous young woman (a mistreated stepdaughter) puts on seven shirts one on top of the other (on the advice of a wise woman , her dead mother). She challenges the snake to shed one of his skins every time she takes off one of her shirts. When he is completely stripped, she whips him and then bathes him in milk [D766.1]. She lies down beside him and he turns into a handsome young man. (The skins are destroyed [D721.3].) (3) A young woman marries a snake who gives her jewelry and turns into a handsome young man. The woman burns the snake skin and lives happily with her husband. Another jealous woman tells her father she too wants to marry a snake. She is left in a room alone with such an animal, who kills her. (Previously Type 433C.) In some variants after the husband is disenchanted, the woman is (slandered by a jealous woman and) banished. She disenchants a prince (who has been transformed into a bird) or a dead man, marries him, and gives birth to a son. Her first husband finds her after a long search. She must choose between the husbands and decides to stay with the first.",

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 451A and 451*.) A girl rescues her twelve (seven, three, six) brothers [P253.0.5, P251.6.7, Z71.5.1] who had been transformed into animals (birds) [P253.2]. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms but they are often mixed with each other: (1) A stepmother transforms her stepsons into swans [D161.1] (ravens [D151.5]). The sister looks for her brothers and finds out how to release them: She has to be silent for some years [D758] and has to make shirts out of cotton-grass for the brothers [D753.1]. A king finds the young woman in the forest and marries her [N711]. In his absence she bears a child, but her mother-in-law takes it away and accuses her of eating the child [K2116.1.1] (having borne an animal). The young queen remains silent because of her brothers, even though she is to be executed. On her way to the funeral pyre her period of silence ends and her brothers are disenchanted. Every thing is explained and the mother-in-law is punished. In some variants the disenchantment of one brother is not complete (he keeps a wing) because the sister cried a tear when her child was taken away (did not completely finish his shirt). (2) A girl finds her brothers in a remote place and keeps house for them. They tell her to take care of the cat (dog), watch the fire, and be careful of the demonic neighbor (ogre, witch). Once she forgets to divide her food with the cat, so it puts out the fire. After the girl asks the neighbor for help, the ogre comes regularly to suck her blood. When the brothers discover this, they kill him. The girl takes flowers (herbs) from the grave of the ogre. Her brothers eat them and they are changed into oxen (sheep, birds). The episode of disenchantment is less important. (3) A mother (father) curses her sons because there is not enough to eat. They are transformed into ravens (swans). The sister seeks for them and asks for directions from the sun, moon, and stars [H1232]. She finds her brothers on a glass mountain (glass palace). To reach them she needs a little bone as a key (gets help from the wind). She releases her brothers and they go back home. In some variants the episode with marriage and slander follows. Some variants start with the promise of the mother to sacrifice the brothers if a daughter (one more brother) is born [S272]. She tries to inform the boys after the birth by a sign [T595], but the wrong sign is sent [N344.1], so the brothers leave home [S272.1].",

God answers the questions and on the homeward journey the traveler passes on the answers and is rewarded [H1292].

This brother wants to divide the farm so he can run his part alone. He works harder than his brother but after a while he wonders why the farm of his lazy brother is more suc cessful. He goes to find Fortune to ask her why [H1281]. On his way he meets things and people that give him questions, and he prom ises to ask Fortune for answers. When he arrives at Fortune he is told that he was born on an unlucky day. He sees that Fortune from day to day has less to eat. When her servants tell her how many people are born on that day she orders that they should have as much as she had on that day [N127.0.1]. On the homeward journey, the man answers the ques tions of the things and people he has met. Cf. Types 460A, 735. Sometimes he marries a lucky woman who brings him good luck. Later he gives someone who had asked him about the owner of the farm an untrue answer, and loses his luck. Cf. Type 737B*.",

Her father tries to get rid of the young man by sending him to the devil (ogre) to bring him three hairs of the devil’s beard [H1273.2]. On his way some objects and animals ask the young man to ask the devil some questions [H1291]. A well wants to know why it has dried up, a tree wants to know why it is withered and the ferryman who rows the hero to the devil wants to know when he will be replaced. With the help of the devil’s mother (grandmother, wife) [G530.1], who asks her son when she louses him or when he is asleep, the young man gets the three hairs and the answers to his questions [H1292]. The ferryman has to give the oar to someone else [Q521.5], the spring of the well is blocked by a frog [A1111], and the roots of the tree are damaged by a treasure (snake). For his answers and help the young man receives a large reward, and the king has to accept him as son-in-law. The greedy king also wants to get treasures on the way to the devil, but he becomes the replacement for the ferryman [P413.1.1].",

An envious king coverts this beautiful wife and, on advice of an evil adviser (vizier, old woman) [H911], he gives the hero (three) impossible tasks to get rid of him [H931.1, H1211]: e.g. to build a castle or bridge in one night, to bring an exceptional baby (who under stands 14 languages), to find a living harp [H1335], to harvest a field of grain in one night [H1090], to bring grapes in winter [H1023.3], to feed an army, to bring a huge tent that fits into one hand, to bring a very small (thumb-sized) man. The man accomplishes two of the tasks with the help of his wife [H1233.2.1]. The last task often leads him to the otherworld, and it is accomplished by one of the wife’s relatives who defeats the king.

  "description": "Three brothers one after the other set out to look for work, or to search for their lost sister [H1385.6] who is married to someone in the otherworld. They are given a difficult job: They must herd seven foals (oxen) and at the end of the day they must bring back a sample of the animals’ food [H1251] (other things). In some variants they have to accompany a supernatural being (sun, death) and are not allowed to talk or to be distracted. The elder brothers fail: They are lured away by a bird, or per suaded by an old woman to rest, or they fail to cross a certain bridge. They are transformed to stone [D231]. The youngest brother follows the instructions and passes across the bridge [F152, E481.2.1]. He sees visions [F171]: Fat cattle in a poor pasture and lean cattle in a green one [F171.1], stones striking on each other [F171.3], and animals which, passing in and out of a church, become human beings and take part in the Holy Communion [F171.5]. The boy takes bread and wine from the altar and brings it to the supernatural being. The visions are explained [F171.0.1]: the fat and lean cattle in the differend pastures fomerly were rich and poor people. The striking stones were people who argued and are forced to continue their conflicts in the otherworld. The animals in the church are angels, priests, or transformed princes. The youngest brother is rewarded and his brothers are disenchanted [R155.1, H1242].",

(2) A person breaks apart glowing coals and finds a treasure under them [N532]. (3) The gold (transformed coal) brings unexpected good fortune to a poor person (child, charcoal burner, maidservant, shepherd, orphan). (4) A maidservant gets glowing coals for her kitchen fire. The next morning, she finds pieces of gold in the ashes [F342.1]. Her master takes the gold away from her. (5) A man who wants to smoke his pipe has no lighter. He takes a piece of coal from the fire, but his pipe will not light from it even on the third try. When he knocks out his pipe, a piece of gold falls out of it.",

  "description": "The Kind and the Unkind Girls) [Q2]. A girl is mistreated by her stepmother [S31] and has to work very hard [H934.3]. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A girl loses an object which is carried off by a river (blown away by the wind), and runs after it (a spindle [N777.4]) [N777.2, N791]. She comes upon an old woman (ogress) who asks her to clean (disarrange) and to louse her head [H935, Q41.2, G466]. When the old woman lets her choose a box as her reward, she chooses the plain one [L211]. (2) A girl falls into a well (is pushed in, jumps in after an object she has dropped [N777]), or follows a rolling cake (ball of yarn, etc. [H1226]). She encounters various animals, objects, or people who ask her for help: e.g. a cow wants to be milked, an old man or woman to be loused or fed, an oven to be emptied of bread, an apple tree to be shaken [D1658.1.5]. The girl helps them all. Then she arrives at the house of an old woman (Frau Holle, old man, supernatural beings like a giant or the twelve months) where she is assigned tasks [G204, H935]: e.g. she has to do the household or farm work, has to feed or louse the demon [G466], has to comb the hair of fairies [H1192], has to carry water in a sieve [H1023.2] or wash black wool white [H1023.6]. She is very helpful and hard-working. In the end she is is rewarded [Q41] with gold, jewels, etc., becomes more beautiful [D1860], or jewels fall from her mouth [D1454.2]. Or, she can choose her reward and is very modest but the reward changes into wealth when she reaches home. In some variants she is forbidden to enter a certain room [C611]. When she breaks this rule, she becomes covered with gold and flees. The grateful animals [B350], objects [D1658], and people of her outward journey help her escape from the demon. After she arrives home, her envious stepmother sends her own daughter on the same journey. This girl goes through the same situations but she refuses help, disobeys, and is unkind. She is punished severely (frogs fall from her mouth [M431.2], horns grow on her head, or she is disfigured, beaten or killed). In some variants the stepmother is also punished. In the end the kind young woman often marries a prince. Cf. Types 431, 480A, and 1180.",

The young woman’s talent is to be tested and she is shut in a room to spin [H1021.8, H1092]. If she fails she will die, but if she suc ceeds the king will marry her. She cries. A supernatural being (a little man) agrees to help her [D2183] if she will promise him her first child (herself) if she cannot guess his name [H521, S222, S222.1]. In some variants she has to remember his name after a long time. The young woman passes the test and the king marries her. After a year the little man, certain that she could not guess his name, comes back to take her child away. By chance the name is discovered (by a servant, the husband or the woman herself) when the little man sings it triumphantly in the forest [N475]. When the woman says the correct name to the helper he vanishes or sinks into the earth [C432.1].",

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 506–506B, 506**, and 508.) One introductory episode is combined with various main parts in which a man wins a princess and a castle. The ending is also very similar. Introductory episode: While traveling, a man sees a corpse which is not allowed to be buried or is ill-treated by its creditors [Q271.1]. He uses all his money to pay the debts of the dead man and for his funeral. Later he meets the grateful dead man in the form of a traveling companion (old man, servant) who wants to help him [E341] on the condition that they will divide all their winnings [M241]. Cf. Type 507. Main parts: (1) The man ransoms a princess, who had been kidnapped, from slavery and marries her [R111.1.6, L161]. While the man is away in another country, the father of the princess recognizes the sail of the ship which is emboidered with the princess’s coat of arms and learns that his daughter is alive. When the man goes back to fetch his wife, he finds that she has been abducted by one of her father ’s courtiers. The man searches for his wife, and the traveling com panion helps him to return to his father-in-law’s court [R163]. There the man discloses his identity as the husband of the princess and gets his bride back. (Previously Type 506A.) (2) The man rescues a young woman from robbers. On their way home by ship the man is thrown overboard by a rival [S142] but is rescued by the traveling companion [R163] and brought to the princess. He is recognized by means of a ring or otherwise [H94.4, H11.1]. The rival is unmasked and punished. (Previously Type 506B.) (3) The traveling companion equips the man with a magnificent horse. A tournament takes place in which the winner is to marry a prin cess [H972, H331.2]. The man wins her. (Previously Type 508.) Ending: The traveling companion asks for his part of the winnings and wants to divide the princess (their baby) [M241.1]. When the man, trying to save the princess, offers the whole kingdom, the traveling companion reveals himself as the grateful dead man, says his de mand was only a test of faith, and vanishes. In some variants the grateful dead man is a saint, who helps the hero because he has redeemed a saint’s picture that was mistreated [N848.1]. (Previously Type 506**.)",

Introductory part: While traveling a young man provides a suitable funeral for an unknown man whose corpse was mistreated by creditors [Q271.1]. Later he meets a traveling companion (servant) who wants to help him [E341] on the condition that they will divide all their winnings [M241]. Cf. Type 505. On their way, the traveling companion obtains (three) magic objects (e.g. boots, magic hood, cloak, sabre, feather). The young man woos a princess who is in love with a magician (ogre, devil). Her suitors have to guess her thoughts three times (bring hidden objects [H322.1], solve difficult tasks). If they fail they are executed. Main part: (1) With the help of the magic objects, the companion of the young man becomes invisible and follows the princess on her way to the magician. There he finds the solutions [H972]. He frees the princess by beating, burning, or killing the magician [T172.2.1]. On the wedding night the young man has to submerge the princess (in different forms) three times in a bath to release her from her en chant ment [D766.1]. (Previously Type 507A.) Cf. Type 306. (2) All bridegrooms of a princess have perished during the bridal night [T172.0.1]. The young man marries her on advice of his companion. A snake (snakes) comes into the chamber or crawls out of the princess’s mouth to kill the young man, but the companion kills it. (Previously Types 507B, 507C.) Cf. Types 840, 1145. Ending: (After a year) the companion demands his half of the winnings and divides the princess in two parts. Snakes crawl out of her body. He puts the halves together and the princess is disenchanted for ever. In a few variants the companion only pretends to divide the princess [M241.1] to test the faith of the young man, and then dis closes his identity as the grateful dead man. Cf. Type 505.",

  "description": "(Cenerentola, Cendrillon, Aschenputtel.) A young woman is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters [S31, L55] and has to live in the ashes as a servant. When the sisters and the stepmother go to a ball (church), they give Cinderella an impossible task (e.g. sorting peas from ashes), which she accomplishes with the help of birds [B450]. She obtains beautiful clothing from a super natural being [D1050.1, N815] or a tree that grows on the grave of her deceased mother [D815.1, D842.1, E323.2] and goes unknown to the ball. A prince falls in love with her [N711.6, N711.4], but she has to leave the ball early [C761.3]. The same thing happens on the next evening, but on the third evening, she loses one of her shoes [R221, F823.2]. The prince will marry only the woman whom the shoe fits [H36.1]. The stepsisters cut pieces off their feet in order to make them fit into the shoe [K1911.3.3.1], but a bird calls attention to this deceit. Cin derella who had been first hidden from the prince, tries on the shoe and it fits her. The prince marries her.",

A king promises his wife on her deathbed [M255] only to marry another woman who is as beautiful as she is (whom a particu lar ring fits). Because she is the only one who meets this condi tion, the king wants to marry his grown daughter. In order to delay the wedding, the young woman asks him to give her dresses like the sun (gold), the moon (silver), and stars (diamonds), and a coat made of many different kinds of fur (a covering of wood). After he provides all these, the daughter runs away from her father [T311.1] and, disguised in the ugly skin [K521.1, F821.1.3, F821.1.4], works as a kitchen maid (goose-girl) in another castle. Cf. Types 706, 706C. When a series of feasts is held in the castle where she works, the young woman secretly puts on her splendid dresses. The prince falls in love with her [N711.6] but does not recognize her as the kitchen maid [R255]. On the following days he treats the kitchen maid badly. During the feasts he asks the beautiful woman where she comes from, and she gives cryptic answers that refer to how he had treated the kitchen maid [H151.5]. He gives her a ring. Then the prince becomes lovesick. In her character as kitchen maid, she slips his ring into his soup (bread). He finds her [H94.2, H94.4] and marries her. Sometimes the young woman is discovered while she is bathing or dressing instead of being recognized through a token.",

She tells her sorrows to a (little colored) cow (red ox, god mother), who gives her food [B535.0.1] and helps her with her work. The stepmother wants to know why the girl is so well fed, and sends her one-, twoand three-eyed daughters one after the other to find out. The girl sings One-Eye [F512.1] and Two-Eyes to sleep, so they learn nothing, but she forgets to sing to the third eye of Three-Eyes [F512.2.1.1], who tells her mother about the cow [D830.1]. The stepmother determines to have the cow slaughtered. When the girl tells the animal this, the cow tells her to plant its bones (intestines, or not to eat its meat). She does as she was told, and a tree (apple tree) grows which continues to help her [B100.1, D1461, D1470.2]. A rich man notices the tree and asks for an apple. When the stepsisters try to pick one, a branch scratches them. Only the girl herself can pick the fruit [D590, H31.12], and the rich man marries her [L162]. Often the tree goes (is taken) with them. The stepmother and stepsisters are punished. Sometimes, the child and the cow run away when the stepsis ter discovers their secret. They pass through brass, silver, and gold forests [F811.1]. In each forest, the cow warns the child not to pick the leaves [C513], but the child disobeys. A brass etc. ox (wolf, lion) comes and fights with the cow of the child. The last of these over comes the cow, which, before it dies, tells the child to save (plant) some part of its body (horn, hoof, skin) because it will help him later [B505, B115]. (Previously Type 511A.) Or, the cow dies after the escape and turns into an angel that flies to heaven. (Previously Type 511A*.) In some variants another woman wants to marry the girl’s father. She promises to take good care of the girl and convinces her to kill her mother by having her look into a chest and dropping the lid on her neck. Cf. Type 720. In other variants, after the stepmother discovers the secret of the cow, she tries to kill the girl in a covered pit filled with burning coals . A dog warns the girl in front of the pit. The stepmother kills the dog and the next day the girl falls into the pit. She is burned up, the cow licks the ashes, and a duck comes out. When her brother comes home, the girl in the form of this duck tells him what happened. He punishes the stepmother. (Previously Type 452C*.)",

In order to avenge himself on the king who dis charged him, the soldier enters a contest to marry the princess [H331]. She has agreed to marry anyone who beats her at running [H331.5.1]. The king permits the soldier to employ his helpers. The runner overtakes the princess, but he falls asleep and is awakened just in time by the sharpshooter. In an effort to prevent the wedding, the king assigns other tasks: eating (drinking) a huge quantity [H1114, H1142], which the eater accomplishes, and staying in an oven [H1511], which the freezing man accomplishes. Finally the king offers the soldier as much money as he and his companions can carry [cf. H1127] if he will give up his claim for the princess. The companions ruin the king and overcome his army. The same motifs appear together in a reduced form. A prince (young man) is looking for a wife. He takes as servants men who help him accomplish tasks that have been set for suitors who hope to marry the princess [F605.2]. In the end he marries her [L161].",

The daughters ask to be allowed to pretend to be men, but only the youngest passes tests which her father sets. He gives her magic objects (a horse) and she goes to the war. In some variants a queen has only daughters and, afraid of her husband’s anger, pretends that the youngest is a boy. Or for other reasons a woman disguises herself as a man and goes out into the world. The woman in man’s clothing [K1837] accomplishes heroic deeds and/or goes into service with a king. The daughter (sister) of the king falls in love with her and wants to marry her. The woman in man’s clothing refuses, or the marriage is unconsumated. In order to get rid of the “servant/husband”, impossible tasks are set. The woman is able to accomplish these with the help of a helper (several helpers, the horse). Cf. Types 461, 465, 513A–513C. In some variants the tests concern the gender of the “servant”, which had been doubted. For example, her manner of eating and her behavior in a garden are tested, or she is asked to bathe with the brothers of the princess. At the end of the tale, the woman in man’s clothing is trans formed into a man. This happens either through a demon’s curse [D11] or a saint’s help, seldom by accident. Then the princess is happy with her husband and the former woman becomes king. Her parents are happy that finally they have a real son.",

  "description": "A prince wants to marry a beautiful princess from a distant land because he heard her name, saw her picture [T11.2, T11.2.1], or saw her in a dream [T11.3]. A faithful servant (adoptive brother, a dead man whom he has redeemed [P361, P311, P273.1]) helps him in this pursuit. The servant poses as a merchant and traps the princess on a ship [K1332], or he enters her room by hiding in a statue of an animal [K1341] (in a magical manner). The princess is kidnapped or goes voluntarily. Cf. Type 854. On the way back, the helper overhears creatures (birds [B211.3, B143]) [N451] prophesy the future. They say that certain dangers that threaten the bridal couple can be averted by particular actions, but also that anyone who reveals this will be turned to stone. The dangers are a horse (other animal) that will run away with (kill) the bridegroom, poisoned food [H1515] (drink, clothing [H1516]), and a dragon who will kill the bridegroom on his wedding night [T172.2]. When the helper acts to avert the dangers, his actions appear excessive and irrational. When he kills the dragon, drops of its blood fall on the bride’s breast. He removes them (with his mouth, or he sucks them out of her body while she is unconscious). The prince construes this as a sexual attack and condemns the helper to death [N342.1]. Before the sentence can be carried out, he justifies himself [C423.4] and is turned to stone step by step [C961.2]. The prince and his wife mourn the helper. The prince discovers (in a dream) that he can bring his friend back to life by sacrificing his own children. He kills (injures) them and rubs the stone man with their blood [E113, D766.2, S268]. The helper is restored to life and he revives the children. Cf. Types 505, 507, and 916.",

  "description": "A prince falls in love with a powerful young woman who will marry only someone whose own power is as strong as hers. Suitors who try and fail are put to death. Although he is warned against it, the prince sets out along with a strong companion to win her [T58]. When they arrive, the helper storms the woman’s defenses, slays her army, and overcomes the woman herself on his master ’s behalf [Z3]. He defeats her in single combat (using a cloak of invisibility): e.g. in a shooting contest with a giant bow [H345.1], in breaking her wild horse [H345.2, F601.2, H345]. On the wedding night the strong woman tries to crush the prince [T173.1]. The helper secretly takes his master ’s place and beats her for three nights with whips made of three kinds of metal [K1844.1]. When the woman discovers the impersonation, she orders the feet of the helper to be cut off [Q451.2, S162] and banishes the prince to the pigsty [K1816.6]. The helper finds a blind companion and together they force a demon to heal them with Water of Life [D1500.1.18]. The helper re turns, overcomes (kills) the strong woman, and rescues the prince [R169.4].",

  "description": "(Including the previous Type 530B*.) A narrative in three parts with several different forms and combinations: (1) At night, a field (haystack, garden) belonging to a family with three sons is robbed (devastated). The sons keep watch. The elder two fall asleep (run away in fear), but the youngest (helped by a mouse, frog, old man) stays awake and captures three magic horses [H1471]. They promise to help him in the future, and he lets them go free [B315, B401, B181]. Or, hiding in a mound of hay, he is carried home by a giant. He kills the giant and finds his treasure (helpful spirits) and three horses [B315, B401, B181]. In some variants a dying father orders his sons to watch over his grave. Out of indifference (fear), the older brothers leave this task to the youngest [H1462]. At the grave he receives three horses, as well as a pipe (stick, bridle) to use to summon them. (2) The king’s daughter is offered in marriage to whoever can ride to the top of a mountain (made of glass, crystal, marble) [F751, H331.1.1, H331.1.2] and/or take a golden apple from its summit. Or he must kiss the princess at the summit and take her ring or scarf [R111.2.2]. In some variants he must jump up to the princess who sits at the window of the fourth story of a building [F1071] (and take her ring), or jump over a grave [F989.1, H331.1.3, H331.1.4]. The young man disguises himself and, with the help of the magic horses, succeeds three times. On the third time, the king (princess) gives him a token (marks him, he is injured). He goes away. (3) Messengers (king, princess) look for the champion, and/or all the men are ordered to march past the princess (the princess sum mons all the men to a feast). Through his token (mark, injury), the youth is discovered at home (in the king’s household) [H80]. He marries the princess. In some variants the horses are disenchanted and become princes (princesses). Cf. Types 313, 314, 314A.",

  "description": "(Including the previous Type 513C.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a clever horse. The tale exists chiefly in three different forms, “The Godchild of the King and the Unfaithful Companion”, “The Golden-haired Maiden”, and “The Clever Horse”. A poor boy goes in search of his godfather [H1381.2.2.1], the king (God, Virgin Mary, etc.) [N811]. On the way he obtains a clever magic horse that offers to help him [B211.1.3, B133, B401]. Against the horse’s advice [B341] he picks up a glimmering feather (golden hair, golden horse-shoe, other bright object), which he later gives to the king. En route the boy is accompanied by a companion (devil, beard less man, Gypsy, etc.) who forces him to change places [K1934] and to swear silence. At the king’s court the boy is employed as a groom. He helps different animals, who in return promise to help him [B350, B391, B470, B501]. A treacherous employee of the king (the boy’s companion) slanders him to the king, saying that he had boasted he could find the bird that had lost the feather and/or to bring the golden-haired maiden (princess) as bride for the king [T11.4.1, H75.2, H1213.1, H1381.3.1.1]. On pain of death he is assigned to accomplish the dangerous tasks [H911]. He succeeds with help of his horse. The abducted princess refuses to marry the old king until she receives certain things (her castle, keys that have fallen into the sea, water of life, etc.). The boy brings these with the help of his horse and of the helpers he had met on his way (grateful animals) [H982, B450]. As the last condition for the marriage the princess demands the boy be killed (burned, beheaded, dismembered, by taking a bath in boiling milk or oil of a herd of wild mares, by water of death, etc.) The horse saves the boy or he is resuscitated by the princess, re juvenated, and beautified [E15.1, E12, D1865.1]. The king has the same thing done to him with fatal results (the princess does not resuscitate him, he dies in the milk, etc.) [J2411.1]. The magic horse turns into a young woman (man) [B313, D131, D700]. The boy marries her (the princess) and becomes king. Cf. Type 328.",

  "description": "A princess is sent to her fiancé, a prince of a foreign country. Her mother orders a maidservant to accompany her, and gives her a small rag with some drops of her mother ’s blood to protect her and sends a speaking horse to take care of her. When during the journey the princess loses her mother ’s charm, the waiting-maid gains control of the princess [K2252, K1911.1.1], forces her to change clothes and roles [K1934], and to swear an oath of secrecy [K1933]. The prince unwittingly marries the maidservant, and the real princess is employed as a goose-girl [K1816.5]. When the false wife orders the horse to be killed [B335], the princess persuades a farm hand to hang the horsehead on the wall by a gate where she passes daily. Every day she greets the horsehead with a formula, and it an swers regretting the injury that is being done to her [D1011, B133.3]. When she speaks a magic formula to make the hat of a gooseboy fly away (to keep an obstrusive goose-boy away from her), he com plains to the king. Thereupon the old king starts observing her and finally makes her tell her life story to a stove [H13.2.7] (her dog [H13. 1.2]) (cf. Types 870, 894). The truth comes to light, the real bride marries the prince, and the maidservant is punished (she un wit tingly declares her own judgment). Cf. Types 403, 425A.",

In order to gain the emperor ’s confidence, the animal tells him that the poor man is very wealthy [K1917.3]. When the poorly dressed future bridegroom travels to his bride’s residence, the animal simulates an accident (robbery), in which all his clothes (horses, bride presents, wedding guests) are lost [K1952. 1.1]. Thereupon the king gives the poor man good clothes and he is accepted as a bridegroom. When the man has to display his property, the animal leaves before him and coerces the shepherds and farmers to say that their herds and farmland belong to the poor man. The animal kills the real owner of the properties, a demon (dragon, ogre, giant, witch, magician) by burning, slaying, shooting or through a trick [F771.4.1, K722]. When the bride arrives with her entourage, the bridegroom presents himself as the real owner of the property. The animal tests the gratitude of the poor man by feigning death (it becomes a human when it is decapitated [D711]). In some variants the man behaves ungrateful or does not keep his promise.",

He goes to the king and asks for store houses and sacks for his coming crops. The king is impressed and believes the boy is wealthy. He tests his noble origin by a bed-test (cf. Type 704). The boy is unable to sleep on the hard couch because he is worried about his lost pea. He marries the king’s daughter. When the king wants to see the property of his son-in-law, the young man meets an ogre (devil, grateful ghost) who offers to give him his castle, but only if he can solve some riddles. The ogre tells all the farmers and shepherds on the way to pretend to be employees of the poor boy. An old man helps him solve the riddles. The ogre and his brothers burst, and the poor man becomes the owner of the castle and its land. Cf. Type 859.",

  "description": "The type combines two different introductory episodes with a com mon main part. Introductory episodes: (1) Every night an unknown thief steals a golden apple [F813.1.1] from the king’s tree. The two elder princes fall asleep when they watch for the thief, but the youngest is successful. He sees a golden bird [B102.1] and shoots one of its colored (golden) feathers [H1471]. (2) A sick king can only be healed by the singing of a golden bird. He orders a search for it [H1210.1, H1331.1, H1213, H1331.1.2, H1331. 1.3]. Main part: The three brothers go on a quest for the golden bird. The first two meet a fox (wolf) which they intend to shoot. The fox warns them against going to a pleasant inn in the village, but they go there never theless. Both of them forget their father and the bird. The youngest son is kind to the fox, follows its advice, and finds the golden bird [L13, B313, B560, H1233.6]. Against the fox’s advice he also takes its golden cage and thus wakes the guards. In order to save his life he has to go on a quest for a golden (magic) horse [B184. 1]. Again, he also takes its golden bridle, so its guards awake, and he is condemned to death unless he brings a golden maiden (prin cess) [D961, N711.3, H1241, H1239.3]. With the fox’s help [B435.1] he succeeds and finally reaches home with the golden princess, the golden horse, and the golden bird [H1242]. Against the fox’s advice he releases his brothers from the gal lows. They steal the bird, the horse, and the princess, and try to kill the youngest brother [W154.12.3]. They pretend to their father that they have brought him the valuable things [K1932]. The fox saves the life of the youngest brother (by using water of life). The golden bird, the horse, and the princess identify him as the man who res cued them. (He marries the princess [L161]) and his brothers are punished.) In some variants the king is healed by the bird’s singing. Cf. Type 551.",

Whoever brings it [H1210.1] will inherit the kingdom. His three sons go on a quest. The two elder haughty ones are diverted from their goal. The youngest is single-minded and friendly towards old men (dwarf, eagle) who show him the way and give advice. With their help he reaches a magic castle that opens only for one hour. He appeases the animal guards (dragon, etc.) and finds everyone else asleep. He locates the fountain of life (golden apple tree) and takes the remedy [H1242]. He sleeps with a beautiful woman (princess) [N711.3, T475.2] and leaves his name (identification token) with her [H81.1]. When he leaves the castle it closes (sinks). On his way back he rejuvenates (releases) the helpful old men and receives magic objects in return. At home his unsuccessful brothers secretly exchange a common (poisoned) remedy for his healing one [K2211, W154.12.3]. They give it to the king [K1932] and he recovers. These brothers slander the youngest and the king orders him to be killed. With the help of his magic objects he is able to escape this sentence. Meanwhile the beautiful woman in the magic castle has given birth to a boy and has discovered the name of the intruder. She ar rives at the head of an army and demands the father of her son [H1381.2.1]. The haughty brothers pretend it is they. They accom pany her, riding beside the golden cloth (path) which the princess has spread, but they find that the gate at its end is closed. The young est brother appears in rags, rides down the middle of the golden cloth toward the castle (is recognized by his tokens), and the gate opens for him. He marries the woman [L161] and becomes the ruler of the kingdom. The old king learns what really happened.",

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 552A and 552B.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Following the wish of his dead father and against his brothers’ advice, the youngest son marries his three sisters to the first suitors who come for them [S221.1]. The suitors take the girls home with them [B620.1, B640]. On a quest for his sisters, the brother reaches the castles of his brothers-in-law and learns that they are the masters of the three animal kingdoms (men transformed to animals [D620, D621.1]; cf. Type 302C*). They receive their brother-in-law in a friendly way and provide him with magic means (parts of their body, feathers, hair, etc.) [B501, B505.1] to use to call them at any time (he leaves a signal of distress). With their help he accomplishes difficult tasks and finally marries a woman (princess). (He is dismembered by an ogre, summons the brothers-in-law, and they resuscitate him; cf. Type 302C*. They also recover his lost castle; cf. Type 560). (Previously Type 552A.) (2) Three girls who despair of being married say that they will marry anyone even if the suitors are animals [C26]. Three animals pass by and take along the three girls as wives. When the girls’ father visits his daughters, he finds food and other things magically pro vided by the brothers-in-law [D2105]. Later (at home) he tries the same method without success [J2411.3] (his effort nearly ends tragically). (Previously Type 552B.)",

Because he rescues them, they promise to help him if needed. Later he falls in love with a princess whose father sets three impossible tasks for him to accomplish. With the help of the grateful animals he succeeds on three successive days [B582.2, H982, B571] and wins the princess. In some variants a part is added in which the man accompanies his elder brothers. When they try to injure some animals, he pre vents them from doing so or compensates for their misdeeds and carelessness. When they trample on an ant-hill, he builds it up again, when they leave wounded animals, he takes care of them, etc.",

He is rescued by his animals, who also drive out the boy’s rival (prince) by their characteristic behav iors: The dungbeetle carries away the prince’s excrement [B482.2], the mouse makes him sneeze, etc., or they torment him for three nights in such a way that he does not touch the princess but soils the bed instead. The king sends him away [T171] and the boy marries the princess [L161]. Cf. Types 571, 857.",

In return he receives a magic ring (stone) from the king of the snakes (father of the rescued snake) which will grant all wishes [D810, D812, D1470.1, D1470.1.15, D817.1, B360, B505, B421, B422] (he finds the ring [D840]). With his wishing ring [D1662.1] he builds a magic castle [D1131.1] and performs impossible tasks (building a castle, a bridge of glass, a church of wax, etc. in one night). He marries the princess, who has a lover. The wishing ring is stolen from him by the princess [D861.5, K2213] (by her lover [D861. 4], another person) who wishes herself and the castle (with the princess) to be transported to a faraway island [D2136.2]. Her husband finds himself poor again. The grateful dog and cat swim to the castle and recover the ring [D882, B548.1, D882.1.1] with the help of a mouse [K431]. On their way back they lose the ring in the sea, but a fish (crayfish) gives it back to them. Finally the boy recovers his ring, the castle and his wife. He punishes the lover (his faithless wife).

When Aladdin rubs the magic ring (lamp) in despair, a helpful genie appears and leads him out. Aladdin reaches his mother ’s house and wishes for riches and a castle [D1131.1]. Both wishes are fulfilled by the genie (by another spirit who appears in the same way when the lamp or the ring is rubbed). Aladdin woos the princess, but her father intends to marry her to another man (Aladdin marries the princess [L161]). The magician exchanges the old, magic lamp (which the princess had kept) for a new, worthless one [D860, D371.1]. He wishes him self to be transfered to Africa together with the princess and the castle [D2136.2]. Aladdin is imprisoned. He rubs the ring [D881] and the genie takes him to the castle where the princess is. She poisons the magician (Aladdin kills him). Aladdin takes the lamp again and uses it to return with the castle and the princess to his home. Cf. Types 560, 562.",

  "description": "A discharged soldier (deserter) is asked by an old woman (witch) to fetch for her a fire-steel (light, tinderbox, candle) from an underground treasury (magic castle) guarded by dogs [D845]. He keeps it for himself (kills the old woman). He discovers that when he lights the fire-steel a helpful spirit (dogs, iron man, giant) appears [D1470.1, D1421.1.2, D1421.1.4, N813]. He orders the spirit to bring the princess to him during three successive nights [D1426]. She has to serve him (he kisses her, impregnates her). The king tries to discover where his daughter goes by putting a mark on the door [R135]. The spirit discovers the ruse and defeats it by putting the same mark on all the houses. The third time the soldier takes the princess, he is discovered (gives up himself) and imprisoned. He asks for his fire-steel, and before he is executed he asks for permission to smoke for one last time. When he lights his fire-steel, the spirit appears and rescues him (and imprisons the king instead) [K331, D1391]. By threatening violence the soldier forces the king to agree that he may marry his daughter. Cf. Types 560, 561. In some variants the spirit is disenchanted by being beheaded or when the candle is burned up [D765.1, E765.1].",

After the poor man arrives home the table does not have any magic power, so he goes back to the giver and complains. The giver gives him a gold-dropping animal (donkey [B103.1.1], hen, etc.). The same thing happens again. This time the man receives a sack containing a magic cudgel [D1401.2] (mannikin) that beats people until it is called off by its owner [D1601.5, D1401.1, D1651.2]. The man himself is beaten by the cudgel. When the greedy innkeeper tries to steal the sack, the cudgel beats him until he returns all the stolen magic objects [D881.2]. Cf. Types 564, 565, and 569.",

  "description": "A poor man receives a ham from his rich brother (the devil) who tells him to “go to the devil” with it. An old man directs him to the devil, where he exchanges his ham for a mill that grinds anything its owner wishes (meal, salt [D1601.21.1], other food; a pot that fills itself with porridge [D1601.10.1, D1472.1.9]). Only its owner can command it to stop [D1651, D1651.3]. The poor man becomes rich. Cf. Type 480C*. His envious brother buys (steals) the mill, but he does not know how to stop it. It grinds such a quantity of food (flour, herrings, porridge, etc.) that the man is overpowered (it fills the whole house with porridge [C916.3]). The real owner stops it and takes it back again. Often combined with the following episode: A ship-captain steals (buys) the mill and commands it to grind salt. He also cannot stop it, and it grinds so much salt that his ship finally sinks. The mill keeps grinding at the bottom of the sea, and this is why sea-water is salty [A1115.2]. Cf. Types 563, 564.",

Three brothers (soldiers, a young man) each receive a magic object from a supernatural being (man nikin, enchanted princess) [D812, N821, D1470.1]: a purse that fills itself [D1451], a coat or cap that takes its owner anywhere [D1520, D1520.11], a horn or whistle that furnishes soldiers or brings power [D1475.1]). The king notices the glamorous life-style of the owner of the purse. By a ruse (by playing cards [D861.6]) the princess steals the purse (magic objects). Its owner gets the magic objects of his brothers, and they are stolen as well. He eats magic fruits (apple, fig, nut, vegetables, magic drink) that cause and cure disfigurement (horns grow on the head, and are removed). He gives (sells) the princess the magic fruits and horns grow on her head [D992.1, D1375.1] (she grows a long nose [D1376.1], is transformed into a donkey [cf. Type 567]). He sells her the healing fruits only when she confesses her theft and promises to return his magic objects [D881.1, D895, D1375.2]. Cf. Type 567.",

  "description": "The youngest of three poor brothers obtains a magic object [D840, D1470.1] (table-cloth, napkin, table, mill) that magically produces food [D1472.1.22]. On his way he exchanges the object for a knapsack that can produce an army [D1475.4] (magic weapon, stick, sabre, cudgel out of the sack). By means of this he secures the first object again [D831]. In the same way he gets other magic objects that function as weapons (hat), make walls fall down (horn [D1222]), provide him with unlimited quantities of money, let him cover enormous distances (seven-league boots, flying carpet), produce a castle (etc.), or resuscitate the dead (violin, flute). Back home he lives a glamorous life. The magic objects are stolen from him by a cunning guest (king, princess, neighbor). By using the last object he recovers them all. With the help of the magic horn he destroys the attacking army and kills the king and his daughter; or, he resuscitates the people he has killed, makes peace with the king, marries the princess, and inherits (half of) the kingdom. In some variants the king is attacked by enemies. The boy res cues him from danger using his magic objects, and marries the prin cess. Cf. Type 465A.",

The youngest of three brothers is kind to an old woman (to whom his brothers were unkind) and receives a magic whistle with which he can summon the rabbits [D1441.1.2]. In order to avoid the mar riage, members (deputies) of the royal family (in disguise) try to buy one of his rabbits. The young man demands a degrading humil i ating act (e.g. jumping on one leg, dancing to the whistle, turning somersaults, attaching a pot to his or her bottom, being beaten, cutting flesh out of his/her own body, branding his/her skin, tear ing an animal carcass with teeth, kissing the backside of an animal [K1288] or of a person, sodomy, eating excrement, kissing him or sleeping with him [K1358]). After the demands are fulfilled, the young man whistles and the rabbit comes back to him. Not willing to admit defeat, the king sets another task: the young man should fill a sack of lies (truths) [H1045]. When the king realizes that the “lies” are actually truths that humiliate the royal family [K1271.1.1], he announces that the sack is filled up and agrees to the marriage.",

  "description": "(Including the previous Type 571A.) A man falls in love with the wife of a smith (crafts man, farmer). In order to get rid of the husband he denounces him to the master (of the castle), pretending that the husband practices magic . The master thereupon orders him to perform (three) impossible tasks [H931, H1010], of which the last one is to make a “Himphamp” – a fictional word without any meaning. The husband gets help (from the devil [D812.3], supernatural being) to solve the tasks, the last one by a magic formula that makes things stick together. He surprises the loving couple in bed and makes them stick together (to the chamber pot [D1413.8]). Or, a man learns that his wife has commited adultery. By means of a magic sticking formula (magician) he makes the loving couple (clergyman and his wife) stick naked to the chamber pot [D1413.8] (basin [D1413.7]) [K1217] (previously Type 571A). Helpful servants get also stuck. The next day the man leads the chain of persons through the streets. Other people (farmhand, maidservant), animals (cow, bull) and objects (food) get stuck in obcene situations and are mocked by passers-by. The man presents his “Himphamp” to the master. All are released, and the guilty ones are punished, made to pay compensation, or pardoned. They promise to reform, they escape, or they drown themselves.",

The son returns successful and uninjured [F615, F615.2.1], accom panied by wild animals that have become his protectors [B315, B431.2, B520]. In numerous variants the boy rescues a young girl (princess [R111.1.1]) during one of his adventures and sends (brings) her back to her father, and/or he meets female helpers (old woman, a girl skilled in magic, his bride). The boy’s mother asks him for the secret of his strength and steals it (ties him, gives him a narcotic drink, persuades him to take a bath) [K975, D861]. Then she (and/or her lover) blinds (murders) the boy. When he is blinded he is found by the princess, who nurses and restores his sight by observing how a blind animal is healed [B512]. When he is murdered he is resuscitated by one of his female helpers (using the remedies he procured). He recovers the object that holds his strength [D880] and takes revenge on his mother and her lover (kills them). He marries the princess (female helper, daughter of the helper). Cf. Type 315.",

When the boy’s father dies, the girl’s parents change their minds and send the boy to sea to get rid of him. The ship sinks but the boy saves himself (on an island). He rescues a child (from a lion, wolf, eagle, dragon, bad man) and receives a magic remedy (magic salve [D1500.1.19], healing water) as reward [D817.1] from demoniac women (dwarfs [F451.5.1], trolls, giants) with which he heals a sick princess (king), and a magic sword (spectacles, binoculars, flute, whistle, bone, gun) with which he overcomes a hostile army [D1400.1.4.1]. He returns home a rich man and marries the bride who had been promised to him in childhood (his first love [T102]).",

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 465A* and 612A.) A man promises his wife (bride) that if she dies before him he will be buried with her [M254, S123.2] (to keep watch at her grave ). She soon (after the wedding) dies. In the grave (at the grave-side) he sees a snake (weasel) revive another dead snake with a herb (three leaves, blade of grass) [B512, B491.1, D1500.1.4]. He revives his wife in the same manner [E165]. His wife then falls in love with another man (ship’s captain) [K2213.5] and, together with her new lover, she throws her husband into the sea [K2213.2, S142]. Or, she leaves her husband and by a ruse causes him to be con demned to death (as a thief). A faithful servant [P361] (friend, his mother) resuscitates him with the snake-leaves [E105]. The guilty pair is exposed and punished [Q261]. In some Indian variants, a god permits a man to resuscitate his wife by giving her half of his own lifespan. She falls in love with another man and tries to kill her husband. He is rescued and asks his wife to return the given years he gave her. She dies for a second time. (Previously Type 612A.)",

Two men (travelers, brothers, tailor and cobbler) argue (wager) [N61] about whether truth or falsehood (justice or unjustice, whose religion) is more powerful. They call on animals and people they meet to act as judges [K451.1, N92]. The loser (the one who stands for the truth) is robbed and blinded, or the wicked man shares his bread with his hungry companion only if he will let his eyes be put out [M225, N2.3.3, S165]. The blind man spends the night in (under) a tree [F1045], where he overhears secrets of birds (other animals, devils, ogres, witches) [B253, G661.1, N451.1, N452]. By means of this knowledge [H963] he is able to restore his sight [D1505.5], to cure sickness (of the princess, king) [C940.1, D2064.1, V34.2], to end drought [F933.2, H1193, N452.1], etc. [N552.1.1, D2101, H1181]. He is rewarded (marries the princess [H346]). His companion, intending to acquire the same wealth, imitates him. He goes to the same tree (sometimes also blinded), but the birds (devils) think it was he who betrayed their secrets, and tear him to pieces [N471].",

An envious person (servant, gardener, cook, smith, general, dwarf, court jester, etc. [K2250]) learns about the prince’s extraordinary ability, and kidnaps the boy. The servant smears blood on the queen’s mouth [K2155.1] (clothes), so she is accused of killing and eating her son, and is imprisoned [Q455]. The prince is rescued and reared by foster-parents (woodsman [R131.8.5, N856.1]). The kidnapper uses the prince’s magic power by telling him to wish for riches (castle). Later the prince falls in love with his foster-parents’ daughter (a playmate he had wished for [T52.1]), who tells him of his true identity. The prince transforms his kidnapper into a dog [D141] and his sweetheart into a carnation [D212.1] (lily, rose) and goes with them to his father ’s court where he takes service as a huntsman. He identifies himself to his father. The queen is released and the male factor is punished. The prince restores his sweetheart to human form and marries her [D630, D711.4, H151.7, L162, S451].",

When they return home they demonstrate their skills to their father [F642, F642.1, F661.1.1, F661.4, F662.1, H504, H1151.12, K305.1]. They all help to rescue a princess who was captured by a dragon [R166, R111.1.3]: The ship-builder builds a fast ship to carry them to the island where the princess is imprisoned (the astronomer discovers the place of her imprisonment), the thief steals her, and the huntsman shoots the dragon (the tailor sews the ship destroyed by the dragon back together [F662.2]). Later each of the brothers claims that he should marry the princess [H621.2, R111.7]. In some variants either their dispute remains unresolved [Z16], or the brothers’ father marries the princess. She may decide herself whom to marry. Sometimes it is proposed that she should be divided, and only her true lover objects (Solomon’s judgment, cf. Type 926). Or, the winning suitor is decided by lot, or the brothers are given money or half the kingdom instead [Q112].",

In order to settle the case they consult a wise man. On their way they see tracks of an animal and make the following deductions [J1661.1]: It was a camel (horse, pack-animal), it was one-eyed (grass is eaten on one side of the road only) [J1661.1.1], it was lame (because of its tracks), it was carrying oil or honey, etc. (drops are seen on the ground), it had no tail (dung on a heap instead of being spread by the tail), etc. When they meet the owner of the lost animal he overhears their remarks, takes them for thieves, and brings them to the judge. They explain their observations to the judge and are absolved. When they are invited for dinner (by the judge) they say the meat is dogmeat [F647.5.1], the wine (bread) smells like a corpse [F647.1], and their host is a bastard [J1661.1.2]. On investigation all their statements are found to be true. The animal had been suckled by a bitch, the vine (corn) had grown on a cemetery, and the mother (of the judge) confesses her adultery. In some variants the judge tells the story of the noblest act (cf. Type 976) in order to settle the dispute of the inheritance. Based on his reaction he declares the youngest to be the thief. Or, the brothers are asked to shoot on their father ’s corpse, so that their behavior discloses the real son and heir (cf. Type 920C). In other versions the judge enforces another test of paternity [H486.1], or he pronounces another of Solomon’s judgments.",

  "description": "A man (youngest of three brothers, cheated heir) is given the power of transforming himself into animals of earth, air, and water [D630, D150, D170, D117.2] by an old man in return for his hospitality (con struction of a bridge) [E341] or by grateful animals [B350] whom he had helped [Q42.1]. He goes into the service of a king who has departed for war and has forgotten an (two) important object (magic sword [D1081], magic ring [D1470.1.15], telescope, war documents, gloves). The king promises his daughter to whoever can deliver the forgotten object immediately. The soldier offers his help. He reaches the castle fast by swim ming as a fish, flying as a bird, and running as a hare [D641]. He presents himself to the princess in his different transformations. She gives him the forgotten object and keeps a piece of his scale, pelt, a bit of fur, and a feather for herself. On his return the soldier is killed by an envious rival [K1931.3]. The murderer takes the forgotten object and claims the reward. When the princess asks to see a second demonstration of the transformations, the cheater fails. She refuses to marry him and her father threatens to execute her. The soldier, resuscitated by his magic helpers [B515], arrives at the last moment [N681], proves his identity (identification by feather [H78.2] and marries the princess. The cheater is condemned to death .",

The king allows him to marry the princess. When she sends him out to sell her needlework, he trades it for (threefold) pieces of good advice. He does not dare to return home without any money and finds work on a ship. When the ship is becalmed, he is sent down to the bottom of the sea to repair it, and there he settles a quarrel between two spirits: What is more precious (more useful, harder): gold (diamond, silver, copper) or iron (steel, copper)? He gives a (diplomatic) answer (following the first good advice). He receives a bag of (precious) stones as a reward and returns to the ship. Together with the merchants he reaches a strange country where the king favors him because of his jewels. The merchants are jealous and make a bet as to who is the richest of them. Following the sec ond advice, he wins the wager and with it all the servants and the ship. He continues to travel and trades for 7–30 years. Finally he returns home and finds his wife sleeping between two strange men. When he is about to kill all three, he remembers the third piece of advice, to think before he acts. He finds that the men are his two grown-up sons. Cf. Type 910B.",

Some days later a fish is given to him in which the ring is found [N211.1].

A fisherman finds the treasure and gives it to a smith (a smith finds it when working). The former owner pays a visit to the finder and tells his story. The finder gives him three pastries (caskets), one filled with earth, one with bones and one with the treasure. The miser chooses the wrong one. Thereupon the new owner tries to repay the miser and gives him a cake with the money inside. The miser pays for other goods with it and finally, after other events, the money reaches the predestined owner again [N212]. Cf. Types 736, 736A, 745, 841, 947, 947A, 961, and 961B.",

The events are usually miraculous: (1) Helping trees/persons: Trees [A2711.4] (weeping willow, poplar, alder, fig [A2711.7], palm), plants (fern, broom, thornbush, thistle [A2711.4.2], hazelnut [A2711.4.1], rose), fruits (date, pine cone, lupine seed), birds (quail, lark, nightingale, partridge, swal low, wagtail, pipit, bullfinch), other animals (donkey, sheep, goats, wolves), people (smith, mason, farmer, blind man, Gypsy), and vari ous things (river, well, stream, hoofprints) help the Holy Family on their flight by sheltering them from the sun or from a storm, or by hiding them from pursuers. The helpers are blessed for their assist ance [A2711.3, A2711.4.3, A2221.5, Q46.1]. (2) In the corn-legend a farmer tricks the men (soldiers) who pursue the Holy Family by telling them that the fugitives passed by when a field of grain, which is now ripe, was sown. The pursuers give up, not knowing that the grain grew and ripened in a single day [D2157.2]. (3) Mary washes Jesus’s diapers and hangs them on a bush to dry. Their healing power causes the dried-out bush to turn green or to bloom, or imparts fragrance to its flowers. (4) Having no where else to bathe Jesus, Mary washes him in certain natural springs, which then and ever after produce warm water. (5) Jesus soothes wolves, which aid the family in their flight. (6) A spider spins its web over a cave in which the Holy Family is hiding. Thinking that no one could have entered the cave recently, the pursuers do not look inside for them [B523.1]. Cf. Type 967. (7) Animals [A2231.7.1] (beetle [A2231.7.1.1]) or plants [A2721.4] betray the Holy Family on the way to Egypt and are cursed. (8) Gypsies refuse to give the Holy Family refuge, and for this they are condemned to wander ever after [Q292.1]. Cf. Type 777.",

Unable to ward them off, he prays to be hung in a chest from the ceiling. The mice go away. When the chest is taken down, the knight is found inside gnawed to death by other mice. Or, the Polish King Popiel flees from mice to a wooden tower on an island. Even there the mice find him and kill him. (2) A prominent cleric (Archbishop Hatto I or II) levies taxes during a famine and demands that those who do not pay (the poor) be burn ed to death. As they die, he likens their cries to the sound of squealing rats (mice). God punishes him for this cruel deed by pla guing him with mice. In order to get rid of the mice, the bishop flees to a tower on a rock in the Rhine (near Bingen). The mice attack him even there and eat him up.",

Examples: (1) A poor woman asks her sister for bread for her children. The sister hides her bread and refuses, saying, “If I had any bread, I would rather wish it would turn to stone”. Immediately, her bread turns into stone. (When her husband later tries to cut the bread she had hidden, blood flows from it.) (2) A lay brother (baker) hides his bread instead of giving any to the poor. It turns to stone, and is hung on the church door as a warn ing.",

  "description": "A hermit mistrusts divine justice, or a man who thinks he is without sin complains about God’s decision of his place after death (punishment [hell] or reward [heaven]). Cf. Types 756B, 756C. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) An angel ceases to appear to a hermit [Q553.2] because he spoke disparagingly of an evil-doer who was taken to the gallows. Thereupon the hermit has to do hard penance [L435.1] by wander - ing about as a beggar with a small dry branch [Q521.1]. The hermit converts a band of robbers with the story of his misfortune. The next morning the hermit is found dead, with green twigs on his small dry branch [F971.1]. (2) A discontented hermit, an evil-doer, and a naked man covered with sand worry about their place in heaven. Angel Gabriel tells them God’s answers to their questions: the place of the hermit will be in hell because he doubts God’s justice, the evil-doer will be in heaven because of his hospitality, and even the sand will be re moved from the naked man because of his ingratitude and impa tience. (3) A criminal has to do penance after confession: every time he passes a crucifix he should say the Lord’s prayer. When doing so he is killed by the relative of one of his former victims. The hermit, his father confessor, sees that the criminal is taken into heaven by angels, and he decides to leave God’s service. When he leaves his cell, he breaks his neck and is taken by the devil. (4) A murderer overhears the confession of a dying hermit. In despair the criminal utters a fast prayer regretting not having lived a life like the pious hermit’s. The hermit hears the exclamation and as he dies, he behaves haughtily towards the criminal, whereupon his soul is taken by the devil. The criminal runs away, falls into a pit, and is taken into heaven by angels.",

The boy wants to go to hell in order to dissolve the contract [F81. 2], and the pope sends him to a hermit [N843]. The hermit di rects him to his brother, a robber. The robber takes him to hell [H1235]. In hell the boy obtains his contract [H1273.1] (after many efforts to per suade the devil) and sees the fiery bed (chair) prepared for the rob ber [F771.1.9, J172, Q561]. In anticipating his punishments the robber decides (is told) to do penance [Q520.2] until his dry staff puts forth fresh blooms and fruit [Q521.1.1, Q521.1.2]. Assured of forgiveness, he dies happy and goes to heaven [Q172.3] (cf. Type 756C). The hermit is astonished but reconciles himself to God’s judgment (blasphemes God and is damned [Q312.3]).

After being rejected by several confessors [V29.1] he is assigned the following penance by an old man: to “plant” a fire brand (live coals, small twig, axe, garden) and to wait until it grows into a green tree [Q521.1.1]; to water the firebrand with water brought from a distance in his mouth [Q521.1.2]; to carry a bag of stones (one for each murder) on his back or an iron hoop on his head till it falls off [Q521.2, Q521.3]; to pasture black sheep till they be come white [Q521.4]. Furthermore he should behave mercifully, carry a traveler over a stream, and offer free hospitality to all [Q523. 5]. For many years the robber does penance in vain until he inter cepts a man who is about to commit a great crime. The robber kills the man and then regrets the deed. Thereupon the firebrand blooms (the stones or the hoop fall off or the sheep turn white). His confes sor tells him that all his sins have been forgiven because of the crime that was prevented by his last murder (because God is pleased with the hundredth murder) [Q545]. Cf.

  "description": "0.1]. A saint (Moses, Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi, St. Peter, hermit) doubts God’s justice and blames him for sending suffering to virtuous people and well-being to bad ones. Or, a saint asks God for the reason for his decisions, an angel asks a saint (hermit) to accompany him to see God’s secret decisions, or, an angel and a hermit meet and decide to travel together. The angel (God’s messenger) forbids his companion to speak or to ask questions [C410, C411.1, C423.2, C491]. On their way the angel does many seemingly unjust and cruel things: he kills the child and/or the servant of a hospitable host and a man he meets in the street [J225.4, J225.5]; he repays hospitality by stealing a cup [J225.3], in hospitality by giving a cup (present); he repays an in hospitable person by constructing a house (rebuilding a fallen wall); he des troys the house (harvest) of hospitable people; he damages (sinks) a ship because of one sinner on board [J225.0.2, U21.3]; he kills the only cow of a poor woman; he offers good wishes to inhospitable people, and bad wishes to hospitable ones. Later the angel explains why each of these strange deeds was just. When the hermit sees the justification for each deed, he agrees that none of God’s acts should be blamed or doubted. God’s deeds are always justified. Cf. Types 759*, 840.",

Thereupon God, in order to show that he cares even for the smallest creatures, tells the angel to fetch a stone out of the sea where a small worm is hidden [D1810.0.1]. The angel is punished by becoming deaf, blind or senseless, or he is driven out of the sky. He has to do penance for his sin on earth [A106.2.1] by pretending to be human and by serving a man (abbot, hermit, custodian, farmer) [A1549.4] on earth. As a servant he works for his master [D1811.2] but he acts in a ridiculous and strange way, smiling mysteriously [N456, M304]. He mocks a man who buys shoes that will last a long time, because the man will die soon. He throws stones at a church (wedding procession) because he sees the devil there. He favors a pub because the people inside pray and ask for God’s mercy. At the burial of a dignitary he behaves disrespectfully, while at the burial of a poor man he renders his reverence [J225.8, J225.0.1.1]. He mocks holy things and scorns a crucifix (holy statue, shrine). He contradicts a judg ment, saying it is wrong. He insults a beggar for being in reality a rich man. When he meets an emperor and his brother, a bishop, he smiles because he recognizes them as the two pitiful children who were the reason why he had been punished, and who had both achieved high positions.

In some variants Christ travels with some of his followers. When they find a treasure he tells them not to touch it but to continue their way. Later two of them return secretly to take the treasure and they murder one another. Or, two men find the treasure and murder one another.

Examples: (1) A priest offends the new (second) wife of a prince. The prince wants to take revenge. He summons the priest, intending to shoot him. When the priest arrives, the prince instead invites him to dinner. The courtiers ask the prince why he suddenly changed his mind. He says that someone standing next to him told him what to do. No one else saw such a person, so the prince thinks it must have been an angel. (2) A girl going through a forest is followed by a man who tries to rape her. She falls to her knees and prays to God, and the man lets her go. A few days later he attacks another girl and is arrested. He is asked why he let the first girl go, and replies that someone was with her. (3) A clergyman who is disliked by his congregation is called to go to the house of someone who is dying. When he arrives he finds no one there. He thinks he was the victim of a prank and goes home. Years later when he goes again to a deathbed, he learns that the false summons had been made by someone who intended to kill him. But the villain saw that the clergyman was accompanied by someone else (angel, man dressed in white) and gave up his plan.",

Examples: (1) The creation of contrasting animals. The devil makes crea tures in competition with God (often copies the creatures God made) [A1751]. (2) The devil tries to create humans but fails, and instead he creates certain animals [A1755, A1811, A1833.1, A1862, A1893]. For example, God makes Adam out of clay and the devil tries to copy him. He shapes the clay and blows life into it, but it turns into a monkey. In other variants, the devil makes inferior races of humans. (3) The good principle competes with the bad one, as God and the devil create various animals. God creates a wolf which is called “God’s dog”, and the destructive devil deliberately creates goats [A63.4]. The devil’s animals devour God’s animals [A2286.2.1]. (4) The devil’s animals are brought to life by God [A1217]. The devil shapes some animals but only God (the name of God) can bring them to life. When the devil refuses to utter God’s name, the animals remain lifeless [A1756]. (5) God takes the devil’s animals. The devil creates (owns) ani mals that God wants for himself. God alters the appearance (colors) of the devil’s animals so that he cannot recognize them [A1750ff., K483].",

She finds it brightly lit and filled with unfamiliar wor shipers – it is the Mass of the Dead. A dead acquaintance (neigh bor) tells her to leave. Terrified, she runs away, but leaves a piece of clothing behind. She goes back but cannot retrieve it because the church door will not open. The next morning, the clothing is found, ripped to shreds, in the graveyard [E492, E242]. In some variants, the witness becomes ill and dies shortly after. (2) A person accidentally witnesses a Mass of the Dead (during Advent, on Christmas or New Year ’s, on All Saint’s Day, All Souls Day, or the day of a particular saint). A priest asks him if he will re ceive (serve) Holy Communion. The man agrees and is blessed. The priest tells him that he had been unable to rest in peace until he could administer this sacrament to a living person. The visitor dies shortly after [E492, E242].",

The companion secretly eats the lamb’s heart (liver, kidney, brain, tongue) and denies having done so. He explains that this sort of animal had no heart [K402]. When God shows his might by various miracles (resuscitation, healing), the man still does not tell him the truth, but instead tries to imitate God. He fails and is condemned to death. God offers his help, but the deceiver prefers to die rather than to yield. Never the less God rescues him. Later God divides a treasure into three parts. The third part is to go to the one who ate the heart, whereupon the companion con fesses that it was he who ate it [J1141.1.1]. Cf. Types 52, 753, and 753A.",

If, at the end of a certain time (seven years), he can solve three (seven) riddles which the devil propounds, he will be released from the contract. The devil has ob jects which appear different from what they really are [H523], and the man must guess their real nature: he-goat – horse, cloth – goat-skin, gold cup – cup of pitch, roasted meat – dead dog, spoon – whale-rib, wineglass – horse’s hoof. Or the devil asks seemingly impossible questions: what is sweeter than honey [H671], softer than swan’s-down [H672], harder than stone [H673]? Or he asks for the symbolic meaning of the num bers one to seven (ten, twelve) [H602.1.1, Z22] (cf. Type 2010]). Or he sets impossible tasks [H1010]. An old woman (devil’s grandmother) helps the man to solve the riddles. Or he finds the solutions by hiding in a tree and overhearing the devil’s conversation with a companion [N451.1, G661.1, G661.2]. Or he is hidden by the devil’s grandmother, who gets the secrets from the devil [G530.4], or is helped by another being (angel, St. Andrew, Gypsy) [N810]. Finally the man saves his soul and escapes from the devil [H543].",

The traveler meets a man (devil, farmer, shepherd, servant, wise man, lawyer, Gypsy, child) who offers to act for him as his lawyer. On the day of the trial the lawyer comes late and excuses himself by explaining that he was cooking beans (other seed) for planting [J1191.2].

  "description": "This miscellaneous type comprises various anecdotes dealing with the devil in Noah’s ark. The motifs mentioned do not all occur in any single variant. God commands Noah to build the ark in secret to escape the deluge [A1015, A1021]. In order to keep the work secret, the ham mer is silent or the axe never gets dull on the stone chopping block [H1199.13, cf. H1116.1, F837]. The devil finds out the secret of the construction of the ark from Noah’s wife. He persuades her to give Noah an intoxicating drink [K2213.4.2], so Noah tells his secret and the devil destroys the ark [cf. G303.14.1.1, K2213.4]. Noah weeps and an angel instructs him how to rebuild it. By performing a washing ritual (water circle) Noah is able to keep the devil away from the ark. A gong calls the animals to board the ark. Some creatures are barred but finally they all enter: the serpent [A2145.2], the insects, the fly [A2031.2], fabulous creatures like the unicorn [A2214.3], the phoenix [A2232.4] and the giant [F531.5.9]. By a ruse the devil manages to enter the ark: he hides near Noah’s wife (at her breast, in her work-basket, in her shadow). She does not enter the ark until Noah calls her with a curse addressed to the devil [C12.5.1, K485]. On board, the devil, in the form of a mouse, gnaws a hole in the ark and tries to sink it [A1853.1], but a cat swallows the mouse. Helpful animals (serpent, hare, fish, dog) offer to close the hole with part of their body (tail, nose); smaller animals (tortoise, salamander, rabbit) are used as a plug. The serpent demands fresh (human) blood every day for its help. After the del uge, Noah throws the serpent into a holy fire. Its ashes spread with the wind and turn into bloodsucking fleas (lice, mosquitos) [A2001].",

When weeds grow in his field, the farmer is converted. (2) A poor and a rich man (farmer, sower, two brothers) sow crops. Saints (passers-by) greet the poor farmer, “May God help you!” The farmer thanks them for the greetings and is rewarded with a good harvest. The saints greet the rich in the same way, but he rejects their greetings by saying that his crops will also grow with out God’s blessing [C454]. His harvest is very poor and he repents his behavior too late. (3) The discourteous sower. A passer-by (God) asks a farmer what he is sowing. Rudely he answers that he is sowing stones. The passer-by wishes him a good harvest, which turns out to be stone plants. (A farmer tells Christ that he is sowing pumpkins [turnips], though his seed is maize. Thereupon he harvests only pumpkins.) [Cf. A2231.1]. (4) Weather forecast. Christ asks farmers if there will be rain. Two answer that frogs (foxes, other animals) predict rain. The third farm er says that he prays to God for rain. Only the last is blessed with rain. (Cf. Type 921B*.)",

The rich man threatens to destroy the icon if it is not redeemed in time. A young man overhears the deal, procures money, redeems the icon, and places it in his mother ’s house. In order to earn money he decides to sell goods at a fair. On his way he gives a lift to an old man who later helps him to endure dangers during a wake. Finally the old man revives the dead daughter of the czar and the young man marries her. The old man makes the young wife into a happy, healthy person before he leaves.

A man (prince , stupid boy, shepherd) makes a riddle based on unusual circum stances which he has witnessed (experienced) [H565]. (She marries him at this point and the tale ends here.) She sends her maidservants and then goes herself to him at night to learn the answer. He keeps her nightdress (braid) as proof [H81.2, H117]. In court, she answers his riddle but permits him to ask another. It refers to her night visit, and rather than answer it, she agrees to marry him. Different riddles are used, for example: (1) I ride on my father and wear (carry) my mother – he has sold his parents and bought a horse and clothes (gun). (2) I ate (am) the unborn [H792] (cf. Type 927) – a fetal animal (he was cut from his mother ’s womb). (3) I drank water from neither heaven nor earth – horse’s sweat (conden sation from a lamp). (4) One killed three and three killed twelve [H802] – his horse was poisoned, birds ate it, thieves ate the birds, and all died. In Turandot the princess herself is the one to set riddles for her suitors to answer [H540.2]: riddle of the sun [H762], of the ocean [H734] of the year [H721.1]. If they are not able to find the solution they will be punished by death. (Previously Type 851A, an Oriental literary tale.)",

The king is provoked and sets what he believes to be an impos sible task. The young man receives as much money as he wants, but within a certain time he has to seduce (find) the princess [H322]. If he fails he will be condemned to death. The princess is hidden in a secret place (tower, room under earth, island, secret room, iron palace at the bottom of the sea) and guarded. The young man demands a hollow golden (silver, copper) animal statue (ram, goat, lion, deer, elephant, ox, horse, dancing bear, bird, eagle) and hides inside it [K1341.1]. The king buys the statue (which can play music) and installs it in his daughter ’s room as enter tainment. At night the youth steals out of the statue and amuses himself with the princess. When the statue is damaged it has to be sent for repair, and the youth comes out. Having won the contest the youth may now marry the princess (after she has become pregnant or has given birth to his child). In some variants a king offers his daughter to whoever is able to find her. Three sons of a merchant travel and reach the town where the contest is held. Two of them fail to find the princess and are kill ed. The third, on the advice of an old woman, orders a hollow gold en animal, inside of which he is carried into the secret hiding place of the princess. When the statue is damaged it is taken back. In this way the suitor comes out again and is able to describe the way to the princess’s hiding place (to show a token) to the king. Or, the suitor has to recognize the princess among several similar looking girls or animals; the princess helps him by giving a sign [H161, H161.1].",

She gives alms to all passers-by [H11.1.1], until eventually she recognizes her husband. In other variants the bride offers a reward to all those who tell her a story. The young man appears and tells his story [H11]. Or, the youth has left his name (a verse) with the bride. In numerous variants it is predicted that the young man will die at the age of twelve (sixteen) [M341.1] but he outwits this fate. Cf. Types 870, 934.",

Types 545D*, 1455, 1459**, 1590, and 1688. This tale exists chiefly in five different forms: (1) A rich man wants to marry his daughter only to a rich man. A poor suitor (sometimes two) pretends to be rich by disguising him self and telling lies to the girl’s father. When the father is ready to marry him to his daughter the suitor burns a wooden tower and pre tends that all his riches have vanished in the fire. Sometimes the bride exposes him by visiting him incognito in his home. (2) After the marriage the bridegroom takes his bride to show her his land. He puts on soiled (patched) clothes. When she looks at the land he points to a patch in his jacket (trousers) saying, “This patch is mine!” [K1917.1]. (Often combined with [3].) (Previously Type 859A.) (3) An uncle wants a wife for his nephew. He gives the boy a coin and food to hold while he makes the arrangement. He tells the girl’s father that his nephew has money in his hand and plenty to eat. So he wins the girl [K1917.2]. (Often combined with [2].) (Previously Type 859B.) (4) When a servant boasts that his house has 150 lights and a goatpen, his master marries his daughter to him. Arriving at his home they realize that the lights are the stars shining through the cracks in the roof and one goat is tied to a tree [K1917.4]. (Previously Type 859C.) (5) A suitor touches his whiskers saying, “All of these are mine!”, whereupon the girl thinks he is referring to the fields and livestock which they are riding past [K1917.7].

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 870C* and 888*.) Because of her faithfulness to her betrothed (separa tion of the lovers by a quarrel or a war), a princess (along with her maid servant, sister) is confined by her father in an underground prison (cave, hollow hill, cellar, tower) [R45]. After many (seven) years she escapes [R211] and enters service in the king’s (father of her lover) castle [K1816.0.2, K1831] (without being recognized). She finds her lover about to marry another (witch, pregnant woman). (She works as lady’s maid for the prince’s new bride.) In order to conceal the pregnancy [K1843.1] (because of the hideousness or sickness of the bride) the heroine is asked to take her place on wedding day. On the way to the church she talks to her horse [H13.1], to the bridge, and to the church-door [H13.2], and thus reminds the prince of his first love. After the wedding he gives her different objects or she loses things which the second bride had given to her (glove, muffler, neck lace, ring, belt) [H151.5]. The prince picks everything up. When in the eve ning the prince tests his wife’s identity by demanding that she repeat their conversation on the way to church [H15.1] she can not recall it without consulting the maidservant. When he demands to see the necklace [H92] (when he asks for the objects he had col lected), the truth comes to light. He sends the second woman away and marries his faithful princess [K1911.3]. Cf.

  "description": "A poor girl (neighbor ’s girl) is determined to marry a prince [T55], who thinks this is an absurd idea. In vain he tries to make her understand that her plans are senseless. When he is about to marry a bride in accordance with his rank, the poor girl takes the place of his new bride in the marriage bed [K1843.1]. The prince discovers the substitution (by the ornaments given to her [H90] or by a stone indicating chastity [H411.1]), but never theless he accepts the poor scorned girl as his wife. Cf. Types 403, 533, 870, 874, and 879. In the oldest variant from the northern area, a goose-girl declares to a prince that she intends to marry him even if he refuses. When the prince finds a bride of his own rank, the goose-girl warns her about a stone which will reveal her past sexual experiences. The bride asks the goose-girl to substitute for her during the wedding night. Nevertheless the stone reveals the truth about the bride’s lost virginity and the prince finally accepts the goose-girl as his true bride. In the southern variants, a neighbor ’s daughter believes (because of a prophecy) that she will marry a bey (shah, prince). When he learns about her idea he mocks her. When he marries a woman of his own rank the neighbor ’s daughter is asked to substitute for the bride on the wedding night, because the bride had run away (was ugly or was not a virgin). Through special signs he discovers the de cep tion and finally accepts the neighbor ’s daughter as his legal wife.",

(2) The father of the girl finds a golden mortar in a field and, against the advice of his clever daughter, takes it to the king who demands the pestle as well [H561.1.2]. (3) A quarrel between a farmer and a nobleman in court is settled by giving both riddles to be solved [H630–H659]. The daughter of the farmer gives the right answers [H561.1, H583.7, H583.9, H641.1, H631.3, H632, H633, H636, H583.8]. (4) A king finds a girl in a house. When he asks her about her rela tives she answers with wit and cleverness. Main part: The clever girl has to perform various tasks set by the king [H373, H712, H1050–H1055, H1057, H1058, H1061–H1065, H1010, H1022.1, H1024.1, H1024.1.1, H1021.6.1, H1021.1, H1023.9, H1023.7, H1023.1, H951, J1191.2, H1152.1, H1185, H601]: she must come to the king neither naked nor clad, neither by horse nor on foot.

Type 821B) or carve a fowl and give appropriate pieces to all members of the family (cf. Type 1533). The king marries the girl [L162] but orders her not to meddle in his affairs. When he settles a dispute between two farmers unjustly, she advises the wronged man to show the king the absurdity of his decision by an equally foolish act [J1191.1]. When the king casts her out and allows her only to take with her the one thing she holds dearest [J1545.4], she takes her sleeping hus band with her and thus moves him to forgive her.",

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 875B1– 875B4.) The contents and combinations of the impossible tasks and their countertasks vary in the numerous variants of this type, where a person imposes an impossible task on someone who, in return, imposes an equally absurd countertask. (1) A prince (king) makes an impossible demand [H1010]: Three unwed girls (virgins) should all give birth to a child at the same time (within nine months). Being summoned to the palace they present themselves disguis ed as pregnant women by hiding cushions under their dresses. When they are granted a wish, the youngest sister asks for roasted snow [H951, J2121]. Being unable to produce it, the prince realizes the absurdity of his own demand and marries the girl. (2) A king imprisons an adviser and will release him only on the condition that he brings a horse that is neither black nor white, neither gray nor reddish brown. The adviser claims to have such a horse at home, but the king cannot fetch it on any day of the week. The king sees the absurdity of his own demand and releases his prisoner. (3) A prince finds a block of white marble so beautiful that he orders his tailor to sew him a suit out of the stone [H1021.9]. No tailor in the kingdom can do this and he orders them all to be killed. Finally an elderly tailor is asked to make the suit. On the advice of his granddaughter he asks the prince for meat made of mud and a cake of snow for lunch. Thus he points to his master ’s own absurd task, whereupon the prince recognizes his mistake and marries the granddaughter. (4) A king orders his adviser (boy) to bring him bull’s milk [H1024.1] or to have a bull bear a calf. The adviser ’s daughter pretends that her father has given birth to a child [H1024.1.1.1, J1533] and the king thus sees the absurdity of his order. (Previously Type 875B1.) (5) A Muslim king orders his adviser to convert him into a Hindu. The adviser stands by the road rubbing a donkey. When the king asks why, the adviser explains that he is trying to change it into a horse (cow). The king thus sees the absurdity of his order [J1536.2]. (Previously Type 875B2.) (6) A king orders his adviser to move a well. On the advice of his daughter, the adviser tells the king that the king must help by send ing him the well. The king thus sees the absurdity of his order [H1023. 25.1]. (Previously Type 875B3.) (7) The king asks a farmer for a tribute of calves born to bulls. The farmer ’s son replies, “Let me go and ask my father who is guard ing the fields, lets fish come up from the seashore and eat the millet”. (Previously Type 875B4.) (8) Other impossible tasks that occur in some variants are: growing onions out of a stone, winding a rope of chaff [H1021.2] (cf. Type 1174), making a rope of sand [H1021] (cf. Type 1174), counting the leaves of the flowers or the stars in the sky, measuring the sky, sew ing a millstone, drying snow on the stove [J2121, cf. Type 1270], dry ing a candle [J2122] (cf. Type 1270). Cf. Types 1172, 1271A*.",

The girl answers with a counter - question: How many stars does the sky have? [H702, H705.3]. The prince does not know the answer and continues on his way asham ed. The next day he returns masked as a merchant (fisherman) and sells something precious to the girl in return for a kiss. Or, the prince repeatedly pricks the girl with a needle; she com plains of insect bites. The next day the prince mocks the girl or reveals the deceit (the kiss and the pricking) to her. Next the girl disguises herself as a doctor [K1837] (death, angel of death), pays a visit to the prince who is feeling sick, and mistreats (mocks) him or makes him believe that death has come to him. Disguised as merchant the girl sells something to the prince on the condition that he kisses his donkey under the tail (his horse’s leg). The prince marries the girl, intending to avenge himself by kill ing her on the wedding night. But she puts a life-sized doll made of sugar (syrup) in her place [K525.1] and hides herself under the bed. When the prince destroys the doll with a sword-thrust and acci dentally tastes its sweet “blood”, he regrets his deed. (The girl comes out of her hiding place and they are reconciled to one another.)

Out of pity (believing in her innocence) the brother spares her and gives the liver (heart, blood) of an animal [K512.2] to the king as proof of the murder. The girl is abandoned. A king (prince) finds her and marries her [L162]. When the king has to go to war (when the woman with her children wants to pay a visit to her father), he tells a servant (officer, soldier, dignitary) or a relative (brother, uncle) to take care of (accompany) his wife. A second attempt at seduction is made [K2250.1], and the woman’s children are often killed. She escapes [T320] in man’s clothes (dis guised as soldier, officer or shepherd) [K1837] and works unre cognized as a servant in her father ’s house (in an inn, as a shepherd). Despite the slanderer ’s statement that the queen is dead (abduct ed, escaped, has murdered her children), the king searches for his wife (father searches for his daughter). Finally all persons concerned meet together and the woman in man’s clothes tells them what had hap- pened (in the form of a tale). The family is reunited and the evil doers are punished. Cf.

A prince (knight, three princes, three young men) enters the girls’ room secretly (disguised as a merchant) and seduces the two elder ones. The clever youngest sister resists his attempt at seduction [L63] and teases the prince. When her sisters have given birth, she dis guises herself as a beggar and carries the newborn children to the princes’ castle (to their fathers). When the merchant comes home and realizes what has happened, he intends to kill the two sisters. (But when the princes agree to marry his daughters he abandons his plan). The prince who wants to marry his youngest daughter plans to kill her on her wedding night. She puts a sugar doll in her place [K525.1]. He cuts the doll with his sword, and when he tastes the “blood” he realizes “the sweetness” of his wife and regrets his deed. (The girl shows up and they are reconciled with one another.) Cf.

The sultan sends a messenger to seduce the wife, but in vain [T320.1]. Disguised as a pilgrim (monk) [K1837], she reaches the sultan’s court. Through her harp-playing and her singing she wins the sul tan’s favor. He presents her with a (three) Christian slave, who is in fact her husband [R152.1]. When the husband has returned home he wonders what happened to his wife. She arrives in her pilgrim dress and identifies herself as his rescuer. (2) A king goes to a foreign land, where he is thrown into prison. His wife disguises herself as a gusli-player [K1837], goes to the hostile king and receives his permission to take one of the prisoners with her. She chooses her husband [J1545.4].

In some variants, before the judgment has been executed, the creditor is offered the money if he will forgo the pound of flesh, but he does not agree. The judgment formally favors the creditor but adds some impossible conditions: when cutting the flesh of the debtor he must take the exact amount (he must not shed blood), otherwise he will be punished severely.

This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A princess marries a prince abroad and gives birth to several children, who are kidnapped by the ghoulish teacher. The teacher leaves blood (other signs) that point at the mother as murderer of her children [K2155.1], she is imprisoned. When the prince goes on a journey, his imprisoned wife asks him to bring her a stone of patience (and a knife), which he does. The prince overhears his wife telling her sorrows to the stone [H13.2.2]. The stone swells and finally bursts because it cannot bear the sorrow (and she tries to kill herself with the knife). The prince embraces his innocent slandered wife, and the cannibal teacher brings back her children. (2) The princess finds a sleeping prince who can only be awakened if she would care for him for a certain period (seven years, seven months, seven days [Z72.2]). Just before the end of the time limit, the princess delegates her task to a female slave and falls asleep. When the prince awakens and sees the slave he thinks that she has saved his life. He marries her, and the princess becomes her maidservant [K2251.1, K1911.1.4]. The princess asks for a knife and a stone of patience. The king’s marshal overhears her telling her story to the swelling stone. When the prince listens, the stone bursts out of pity [H13.2.2]. When she is about to kill herself with the knife, the prince interferes. They marry and the slave girl is punished.",

The prince does not recognize her extraordinary origin, so she stays mute and rejects him. The prince marries three women of royal blood, but they all die when they try to imitate the abilities of the first woman (e.g. objects obey her commands, her cut nose grows again, when she puts her finger in hot oil cooked fish appear, etc.). When the prince feigns an illness the girl cares for him, reveals her origin, and consents to the marriage. In other variants the prince overhears objects quarreling and learns how he should address her: daughter of the sun (daughter of the sea, etc.). When he calls her in this way she speaks and marries him.",

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 910J and 911*.) A dying man gives three precepts to his son (to another person) [J154]. Each vari ant includes three of the following precepts: (1) Never tell a secret to a woman [J21.22]. (2) Do not make friends with (trust) a policeman [J21.46] (soldier [J21.46], ruler [J21.28]). (3) Do not plant a thorny tree (without permission) on your property [J21.52]. (4) Do not adopt a child [J21.27] (godchild, orphan, child of thief). (5) Do not visit your friends (parents) too often [J21.9]. (6) Avoid the house of a red-bearded man. Cf. Type 1588**. (7) Do not marry a woman from abroad [J21.4] (be careful in your choice of a wife). (8) Do not let your wife go to a wedding accompanied only by her parents (do not let her go for a long visit to her parents) [J21.47.1]. (9) Do not bargain for your horse [J21.26], do not make it run down a hill [J21.24]. (10) Do not lend your horse [J21.10]. The son (person) disregards his father ’s precepts (he thinks they are nonsensical) and suffers misfortune (in order to test the precepts, he acts against them). (1) After burying (hiding) an animal (human being) at a special place he tells his wife about it. When they quarrel and he beats her, she calls him a murderer and he is arrested. (2) His friend arrests him without listening to the true version of the event (he condemns him by jumping to conclusions without iden ti fying the victim). (3) His turban sticks in the thorns of a tree, and his friend forces him to present himself without it. (The thorn tree he planted causes for a quarrel with a neighbor to whom he has to pay compensa tion.) (4) His adoptive son is willing to execute him, when an executioner is not available. (5) His hosts are annoyed by his numerous visits and offer him bad meals (mindful of his father ’s advice, he keeps a sample). (6) He passes the night in a forbidden house (where a red-haired man lives). After taking a short-cut, he finds himself in a den of thieves. He escapes (with the help of a servant whom he later mar ries). (7) He finds out that the woman he intends to marry has a lover (he keeps his trousers as evidence). (8) He lets his wife go to a wedding with her family and her new-born child. Disguised himself as a Turk, he meets her and tries to seduce her and takes her son away. His mother-in-law sets fire to the house and says that the child was killed in the fire. The husband re turns the child and forgives his wife. (9) Nobody wants to buy his horse because the price is too high. It falls sick (is injured) and dies (he keeps the skin as evidence). (10) His mare, which his friend had borrowed, dies from over work. When his friend apologizes for his mistake he forgives him. Finally he realizes that his father ’s precepts were indeed wise. (1) Just before he is arrested, he shows the judge where to find the victim. (2) To his astonishment, it is an animal. (3) It turns out that the missing person (animal) is still alive. (4) He explains that he had only intended to test the precepts of his father. (5) He is immediately freed and prosecutes the persons who tried to harm him. (6) He invites his bride and his parents to his home. (7) He explains to them the significance of the souvenirs of his errors. (8) He casts off his bride.",

  "description": "(Including the previous Type 910H.) A poor man who cannot provide for his family takes service with a rich farmer for one year for a certain amount of money. After he has completed his service, the farmer gives him his choice of the agreed wages or a good precept. The man chooses the precept: “Always follow the main road” [J21.5]. Disappointed by this he hires on for a second and then a third year after which he is given various precepts: “Mind your own busi ness” [J21.6] or “Do not sleep where a young woman is married to an old man” [J21.3] and “Always postpone your anger until the next day” [J21.2]. (For other examples see the numerous subdivisions in the Motif-Index [J21ff.].) Feeling discouraged the poor man gets ready to go home. His master gives him a loaf of bread (with money hidden inside [J1655. 2]) which he should not cut until he reaches home [C320]. At a fork in the road the poor man follows the farmer ’s advice and takes the old main road instead of a shorter new one [J21.5]. He later learns that he would have been waylaid by robbers on the new road [N765, J865]. At dusk he reaches a house where he spends the night. There he sees strange events, but he does not interfere [J21.6]. When he is about to leave, his host calls him back and rewards him with a large sum of money for his discretion (indiscretion would have brought death to the host’s wife [D700, D758]). After he has refused to sleep in a house where a young woman is married to an old man [J21.3], he witnesses a murder [K2213.3]. When an innocent man, who spent the night at the woman’s house, is condemned for the murder, he testifies to the man’s innocence [K2155]. When the poor man finally reaches home and looks through a window, he sees a stranger kissing his wife. He intends to kill the man, but fortunately postpones his anger at the last moment [J21.2, J571]. The stranger was his own grown son. When the family gathers around the table to celebrate their reunion, the poor man cuts the bread and finds all the money he had earned hidden inside [Q20.2].",

The old man gives him the following maxim: “Whatever you do, do wisely and think of the consequences” [J21.1] and he adds that if the young man will follow the precept he will become the most powerful person in the whole kingdom. Upon his father ’s death the young man becomes king and orders that the maxim be displayed on all the walls of the palace. When enemies bribe his barber to cut the king’s throat while shaving him, he reads the maxim at the last moment. Afraid of the possible consequences, he confesses his intention (and desists from his plan). The value of the precept is recognized.",

First: “Never associate with enviers or slanderers” (“Do not talk about what you have seen” or “Do not dishonor your master ’s house with adultery”). Second: “Always sympathize with your master ’s fortune and emotions”. Third: “Never pass a church without going inside” (“Never neglect to go to mass”). When his father has died the young man begins his service at the king’s court. An envious man slanders him and accuses him of de siring the queen. When he, following his father ’s advice, starts to weep when the queen weeps, his behavior is interpreted as proof of a love affair and it is decided that he must be killed. His adversary (slanderer) intends to throw him into the blast furnace of the ironworks (limekiln, mine, well, brewery, baking oven) or to kill him by some other means. He is sent to the place where he is to be killed. Those who are charged with his murder are told to kill the first man who arrives (he brings along a message, a letter commanding his murder [K978] or cer tain object such as a handkerchief or lemon). According to his father ’s advice, the young man goes to mass on the way and is delayed. His slanderer (adversary), impatient to see him dead, arrives the place before him and is killed instead of him. The innocent young man then reports his slanderer ’s death. He is restored to favor, or gains fortune, wealth and honor [K1612]. Cf. Type 930.",

(2) A sick (injured) man covered with sores is bothered by flies. He refuses any help, saying that hungry flies bite twice as hard as full ones. (3) A merchant is captured by robbers (farmers want to punish a cor rupt mayor or a thievish miller, a landlord wants to punish one of his tenants). They undress him (and cover him with honey) and tie him to a tree where there are many flies. A man (knight) offers to drive the insects away, but the merchant refuses, saying that others even worse and more hungry will come in their place.

The child asks the servant for mercy; he is not killed [K512] but raised by a smith. In order that her husband should not discover this deceit, the queen takes the smith’s son as her own [K1921.1]. During their childhood, the two boys play along with others. In their game, Solomon stands out because, playing the part of the king [J123, P35], he convicts one of the boys as a traitor. Or, the smith’s son speaks of farming matters, but Solomon speaks of military af fairs. His father the king (in person or through a messenger) tests the boy’s wisdom with impossible tasks or difficult questions [H921]. Or, the boy (often acting as a shepherd [K1816.6]) makes wise judg ments or observations that reveal his royal origin [H41.5]. His intelli gent answers show him to be the son of the king. Cf. esp. Types 875, 921, and 922. In some variants an additional episode may follow, but more often this is a separate tale: Solomon’s wife elopes with a rival king. Solomon goes to retrieve her. He is captured but is permitted to blow his horn three times before his death [K551.3]. This was a pre arranged signal, and his army comes and rescues him.",

The princess plays the role of the king and points out that chickens could never hatch from boiled eggs. The king adopts the girl’s decision [J123].

  "description": "A farmer (craftsman) responds to the king’s question, why he is working so hard or how he would use his salary (four coins, bread), by giving enigmatic answers: The first I eat (feed myself), the second I put out at interest (give to my children so that they can care for me when I am old), with the third I pay debts (keep my parents) and the fourth I throw away (give to my wife) [H585.1]. The king asks his ministers to interpret the farmer ’s answers for him. When they ask the farmer, he demands a reward for each response. In a medieval version, a smith named Focus, who worked on a feast day despite the emperor ’s prohibition, is betrayed by a statue constructed by the magician Virgil. He defends himself by stating that he needs to earn eight coins daily. Two of the coins he has to re pay (to his father), two he has to lend (to his son), two are lost (to be given to his wife) and two are to be spent (for himself).",

  "title": "Best Friend, Worst Enemy",
  "description": "The central motif of the tale is the following task: A man should bring his best friend and his worst enemy [H1065]. He fulfills the task by choosing his dog as friend and his wife as enemy. The tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) When the master orders his servant (Aesop) to bring food to the person who loves him most, the servant serves his dog instead of his wife. The wife feels offended and threatens to leave her hus band. The servant explains that only the dog would really love his mas ter for it would return even if it had been beaten. (2) A young man violates the order that all old people should be killed. He hides his father with the help of his wife. Because of the intrigues of some envious men, the king demands that the young man, on pain of death, bring his servant, his friend (jester) and his enemy to the king. Following his father ’s advice he takes his donkey as servant, his dog as friend (his child as jester) and his wife as enemy. The offended wife reproaches her husband for classifying her in this way after she had helped him hide his father. This be trayal turns her into his enemy and so he accomplishes the task. Cf. Type 981. (3) A young man rescues the devil (stranger, saint, ghost, robber) from a wolf (other danger) whereupon the devil promises pay for the service if the young man will bring his most faithful friend to the meeting. The man comes with his wife. The devil appears in a rich disguise and persuades the wife to kill her husband when he is asleep. Later he promises her marriage and wealth. The woman agrees. When she raises the knife (ax, stone) for the murder, the devil awakens her husband. He says that he has now repaid the man by saving his life, and refuses to pay the recom pense. The man should have brought his dog instead of his wife. (The man must bring his real friend the next day. His dog follows him without being called, attacks the stranger, and proves its faith fulness.) Cf. Type 824.",

A person of high social status (emperor, king, civil servant, teacher) demands that a clergyman (bishop, abbot, priest, petitioner) answers three difficult questions within a certain period of time on pain of death [H512, H541.1]. The clergyman cannot answer the questions and therefore sends a (disguised) representative [K1961] (servant, shepherd, miller, brother ). This man answers all the questions correctly for him. When the deception comes to light, the questioner forgives the ruse and re wards the person who answered [Q113.4] (often spares the life of the superior or the brother). Many of the questions require measuring (counting) something that cannot be measured (counted). By means of wordplay (How much does the moon weigh? A pound, since it has four quarters [H691.1]), by setting an impossible condition at the end of a nonprovable statement (How many leaves are on the tree? So and so many, and if you do not believe, count them [H705.2], or as many as there are stems [H705.1]), or of a non-provable comparison (How many stars are in heaven? As many as grains of sand are on the beach, and if you are able to count them, you know how many stars are in heaven [H702]), etc., the person answering turns the questioning ad absurdum. The questions include, “How many drops of water are in the sea?” [H696.1]; “How high is heaven?” [H682]; “How many hairs are on my head?” [H703]; “How many seconds are there in eter nity?” [H701.1]; “How far is one end of the world from the other?” [H681.1]; “Where is the center of the earth?” [H681.3.1]; “How much is the king worth?” [H711.1]; “What is the sweetest song?” [H634]; “Which is the best fowl?”; “What is the swiftest, the sweetest and the most costly?” [H633, H638]; “How much is a golden plow worth?” [H713.1]; “What does God do?” [cf.

He lets a child sitting in a basket be carried into the air by an eagle, where the boy exclaims, “Give me stones and lime so that I can start building the palace!” After solving all the riddles set by the king, he returns with a rich reward.

Nevertheless the snake creeps through his mouth into his body, deforms him, and makes him sick. The prince is cast off by his father and becomes a beggar [L419.2]. Through his wife’s wit (skill) the beggar becomes rich, becomes a king, or is cured of his disease [N145]. In other variants the husband magically returns to his former iden tity as prince [D1866]. The father visits the new king, recognizes his daughter and is forced to admit that she is responsible for her own fortune.

  "description": "This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with the idea of unusual, of ten clever, methods to determine the truth [J1141ff.]. Cf. Types 1534, 1833J, and 1833K. Examples: (1) A poor man finds a purse with money in it and returns it to its owner hoping for a reward. The owner pretends that some money is missing, and that the finder took it already for his reward. The judge decides that, since the amount of money is different, the purse did not belong to the man who claimed it, and that the poor man may keep it until its rightful owner is found [J1172.1]. (2) A judge gives sticks to all the suspects in a court case and tells them that the guilty one’s stick will grow during the night. The guilty man cuts a bit off his stick and thus is discovered. (3) Someone announces to all the people in the village that the thief has a gnat on his cap (that his cap is burning). One man reaches for his cap and thus shows himself to be the thief [J1141.1]. (4) All the suspects are required to touch some object in the dark, and are told that the hand of the guilty one will be blackened. In fact, the object blackens any hand that touches it. The guilty man does not touch the object and is thus the only one whose hand is not black ened [J1141.1.4]. (5) In order to determine which of two women is the owner of a spindle of thread, the judge asks them what the spindle is made of. Only the owner knows the right answer [J1179.6]. (6) Disputants are ordered to fabricate a copy of the disputed ob ject (precious stone) [J1154.2]. The owner and the cheater can do so, but the false claimants cannot. (7) A man (innkeeper) whose silver has been stolen summons his guests (employees) to the table and orders them to make various ridi culous gestures. When they are all engaged in this game, he com mands them to put their heads under the table. Then he asks if the thief has head under the table. The thief answers, “Yes”.",

For example, two cats fight over a rice cake, and the monkey who is to decide the case eats it. A lawyer who is to decide the case of two men charges them such high fees that he is able to buy the disputed object (calf) with his earnings. The song of a bird was not meant for the plaintif but for the judge. Cf. Types 51***, 400, and 518.",

The riddle refers to extraordinary or accidental events that happened to the person setting the riddle, and thus is unsolvable for outsiders. There are four main riddles: (1) Samson riddle of the living in the dead, “From the eater came forth meat and from the strong sweetness” – Swarm of bees col lects honey in a lion’s carcass [H804]. (“What has seven tongues in one head?” – Bird’s nest with seven young found in a horse’s head [H793]; “Drink this wine which a bird took to its nest” – A stork took a bunch of grapes to nest, and a boy makes wine from them [H806].) (2) Riddle of the nursing daughter, “Formerly I was daughter, now I am mother; I have a son who was the husband of my mother” – Woman has nursed her imprisoned father (woman nurses her son, wife nurses another man) through a crack in the prison wall [H807, R81]. Cf. Type 985*. (3) Ilo-riddle (propounded by a woman), “Love I sit, Love I stand; Love I hold, fast in hand; I see Love, Love sees not me. Riddle me that, or hanged I’ll be” – A woman has killed her dog named Love (Ilo); from its skin shoes, gloves and a chair-covering have been made; (“With what thinks, I drink; what sees, I carry; with what eats I walk” – A woman has killed her lover, from his skull a cup has been made, from one of his eyes a ring and she carries two of his teeth in her boots [H805]). (4) Riddle of the unborn, “I am unborn; I ride the unborn (I eat the unborn)” – A boy was born by Caesarean section; he has a horse that was also born unnaturally (he eats the meat of an animal that was taken out of its dead mother ’s body) [H792].

A rich man (king, merchant, landlord) learns of the prophecy (he dreams) that a poor boy will become his son-in-law (heir). Therefore he tries to kill the boy by various plots (exposure). Finally the boy has to deliver a letter that orders his own death [K978]. The letter is exchanged (modified) by a helper [K511], so that the boy is married to the daughter of his adversary and shares in his rank and wealth [K1355]. Cf. Types 461, 910K, and 1525Z*.",

Not willing to marry the ugly child, he tries to kill her [M370] by stabbing her [S115], by piercing her forehead with a needle [S115.2], or by adopting her in order to expose her afterwards [M371, S143]. The girl sur vives [R131], grows up, becomes very beautiful [D1860], and is mar ried to the man. After the wedding he discovers the scar [H51] (needle) and learns from his wife’s life-history that the prediction has been ful filled despite his actions [N101]. In various regions different forms of the tale have originated (previously Types 930B–930D): Northern cycle (Danish, Swedish, Estonian, Irish and Icelandic vari ants): A man witnesses the prediction of his future, tries to kill the girl in various ways by exposing her in water, by nailing her by her hands to a tree, or by sending her out with a letter that orders her death. The girls survives, marries the man, and is finally recognized by her scars as the predestined wife. Southern cycle with a wide regional dispersion (Greek, Slovene, English, Scottish, Irish, Estonian, Spanish and Brazilian variants): The marriage of the fated child is combined with the further condi tion: A ring that had been thrown into the water has to be found again. The ring is finally located in a fish’s belly [N211.1]. Cf. Type 736A.",

  "description": "This miscellaneous Type comprises various tales (with legendary traits) dealing with a person who kills his father (parents). Examples: (1) A father reproaches his son for his dissolute life, and the son kills him. A saint protects the sinner from despair and leads him to repent and do penance for his crime. (2) It is prophesied that a certain child (Judas) will bring great sorrow to humanity. The child is exposed but is adopted and raised by a childless queen. When she gives birth, the adopted child mur ders her child and flees to Jerusalem. When he steals apples in a garden he is caught there by the owner. He kills the owner and marries his widow, who is (although he does not know this) his own mother. (3) It is prophesied that a certain young man (Julianus Hospi tator) will murder his parents. He flees in order to avoid this, and marries. His parents search for him and come to his house, where his wife invites them to rest in their marriage bed. When the son arrives home and sees two people in his bed, he thinks his wife is unfaithful to him and kills both of his parents. When he learns what he has done, he repents and does penance. His sin is forgiven. Or, a young man kills his parents (father only) because a false adviser has lied to him, saying that his wife is an adulteress. (4) After his wife dies, a lord falls in love with his own daughter. She gives birth to a son (Albanus), who is exposed. He is rescued and raised by a childless king. When the boy grows up, he becomes king himself. His natural father hears about this young king and marries his daughter to him. Before the adoptive father dies, he tells the young man what he knows about his origins. The young man’s wife realizes that she has married her own son. After the king dies, the three others go to the bishop and confess their sins. They are required to do penance for seven years. On their way home, they spend the night in a forest, and the father and daughter renew their incestuous relationship. Albanus discovers this and kills them both. He becomes a hermit, is killed, and later becomes a saint. (5) A drunken man spends the last of his money. The devil promises to make him rich if he will murder his own parents, but the man refuses. The devil gives him money anyway, and tells him to restrict his binges of drunkenness to one day each week. The man disobeys, gets drunk every day, and murders his parents [Q211.1, S22].",

At the age of 15, the child Gregorius learns about his mys terious origins and leaves in order to find his real parents. Unwittingly Gregorius reaches his native country where his unmarried mother rules. When he saves her from a neighboring ruler ’s unwelcome advances, she agrees to marry Gregorius. He has no idea that she is his mother. When she finds the tablets with the history of his origins she discloses her identity. In order to expiate the unwitting incest, she lives a pious life. Gregorius undertakes a pilgrimage as penance. At his request a fisher man fetters his ankles with chains to a rock in the sea [Q541.3] and throws the key into the water [Q544]. Seventeen years later Gregorius is chosen by an angel as successor of the deceased pope. Messengers from Rome look for Gregorius and arrive at the fisherman’s hut. In a fish prepared for the guests, the key for his chains is found (cf. Type 736). Gregorius is elected pope, and when he enters Rome healing miracles take place. His mother makes a pilgrimage to Rome in or der to confess her sins to the pope. They recognize each other [H151. 3]. She enters a convent.

But the goat con founded the messages, and the dog [B291.2.1] arrived too late to change it [A1335.1.1]. Since that time, humans die forever. (2) God sends out a chameleon to tell humans that they should live forever (continue to live after death). On the way the chameleon is overtaken by a faster animal that delivers the opposite message [A1335.1]. (3) Formerly Death walked along singing [Z111], but he did not enter the houses of men. An old woman listened to him, liked his song, and repeated it. Thereupon Death followed the woman to her house and bedroom, and when she lay down (to have sexual inter course) he strangled her. This is how Death first entered the houses of men. (4) In the year before they were to die, people neglected their responsibilities (they repaired their fences with temporary mate rials). Therefore, God decided that they should not know in advance when they will die [A1593].",

When he reaches his parents’ home in humble clothing [K1815], his father accuses him of lying and punishes and humiliates him (by forcing him to tend pigs, goats, sheep, geese). His wife (disguised as hermit, priest, bishop [K1837]) follows him, (overwhelms the robbers) and rescues him from the difficult situation. He then puts on his royal clothes, returns home, and proves his royal identity to his parents.",

Both are baptized to - gether with their two sons. Placidas is named Eustacius, his wife Theopiste . When Eustacius rides again to the place of the vision, the deer reappears. Christ prophesies for him a period of suffering similar to that of Job. He can choose if he wishes to have the suffering now or at the end of his life [J214]. Eustacius decides to have it soon. When his servants and his animals die and all his property is stolen, he escapes with his family to Egypt. A boatman claims his wife as payment for the ferry; when Eustacius crosses a river with his two sons, the boys are carried off by a lion and a wolf [N251]. Farmers and shepherds take the animals’ prey and raise the boys. Eustacius works as farmhand. Many years later Eustacius is found by a legation of the emperor. They persuade him to return. When serving as colonel, he recovers his sons and his wife by chance [N121]. The new emperor in Rome wants them to make sacrifices to idols. When they identify them selves as Christians, the new emperor Hadrian orders them to be thrown to the lions, but the wild animals do not touch them. Then they are pushed into a red-hot iron bull. Their uninjured bodies are buried by Christians; on the grave a church is built.",

As a test a shepherd (gardener, farmer) is endowed with intelligence. He participates in a suitor-test for a mute princess, who is offered in marriage to whoever can make her speak [H343]. The clever shepherd tells to the princess that end with a question [F954.2.1, Z16.1] (e.g. a carpenter, a taylor and a clergyman pass the night together. The carpenter carves a girl, the tailor dresses her, and the clergyman animates the figure [F1023, D435.1.1]. To whom does the girl belong? [H621]). Cf. Types 653, 653A. When the princess continues to be silent, he starts to talk to objects or animals who answer wrongly (he himself) in order to tempt the princess to contradict them. Finally she breaks her silence. Cf. Types 559, 571–574. But the king refuses to give the shepherd his daughter and condemns him to death. He is saved by Luck [N141], which means that Luck is more powerful than Intelligence.",

If one tells her about the theft of the treasure, she is to seize him and hold him fast [K425]. When the thief visits the princess she marks his forehead [H58], whereupon he marks all the other suitors in the same way [K415] (he brings along his dead brother ’s arm, which is what the princess seizes). Impressed by the thief ’s cleverness, the king announces that he will give his daughter to him. The thief discloses his identity and is honored as the most cunning Egyptian of all. Cf. Type 1525.",

This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) A ruler, roaming about incognito (during the night), meets some robbers [K1812.2]. They boast of their extraordinary abilities and qualities: One can open any door, one understands the lan guage of dogs, and one recognizes any person he has seen once, etc. The king then states that he can save any person from the gallows. To gether they rob the royal treasury. When the robbers are captured the next day, the king makes his statement come true. (Previously Types 951C and 951A*.) (2) A man (king, bishop, clergyman) is warned that he will die if he does not perform robberies. He does so, and meets a robber (often a man of honor, cf. [3] below) from whom he learns that he himself would be murdered. They both exchange their identifying marks (caps, clothes) and meet again later. The leader of the conspirators is then forced to poison himself. His accomplices are punished and the robber is rewarded. (Previously Type 951B.) (3) A robber (soldier) can open any door with a certain magic object, but he only steals the profit that merchants have earned unjustly [K1812.2.1]. The king wonders about the robber ’s wealth, dis guises himself, and joins him. While robbing the royal treasury the robber prevents the king from stealing (criticizes his greed). The next day the king discloses his identity and rewards the robber for his honesty. (Previously Type 951A.)",

  "description": "(Ali Baba.) (Including the previous Type 676.) The tale consists of two parts: (1) A poor man (woodcutter) witnesses robbers entering into a mountain by pronouncing magic words like “Open, sesame” [D1552.2]. He then tries the formula [N455.3], enters the mountain, and finds a huge amount of gold [F721.4, N512] which he takes home. (2) His greedy brother, who lends him money scales, discovers his secret when a piece of gold remains in the scale [N478]. The brother goes to the mountain, but he is dismembered by the robbers because he forgets the formula for opening the mountain [N471]. At the request of his sister-in-law, the woodcutter fetches his brother ’s corpse, tells a cobbler to mend it and buries it. The robbers plan to take revenge. With the cobbler ’s help they find the house of Ali Baba and mark it with a chalk circle, whereupon his maidservant (daughter) marks all other houses in the same way. The robber chief disguises himself as a merchant and asks the woodcutter for lodging for the night for himself and for his mules laden with jars (casks) of oil. When the maidservant goes to take some oil for her lamp, she realizes that only one jar is filled with oil, and that the robber ’s companions are hidden in the others [K312]. She heats the oil, pours it into the jars, and kills the robbers. The robber captain escapes and comes back in disguise (as a suitor ). At dinner he asks for a meal without salt (in order not to be obliged to his host). Thereupon the maidservant becomes suspi cious, recognizes the robber, and kills him. As her reward the woodcutter marries her to his son (nephew).",

The bridegroom asks his bride to pay him a visit in his castle in the forest. She sets out before the arranged time, marking the path with peas [R135] or ashes (the bridegroom has marked the way). When she reaches a house, animals (bird) warn her that it is a house of mur derers and that she should go back (she gives food to watch dogs in order not to be betrayed). She finds corpses in the house. When she hears the robbers coming, she hides. Her bridegroom (the robbers) brings in a young woman, kills her, and cuts her into pieces. Her finger with a golden ring on it falls into her hiding place. The bride runs away at night and finds her way home safely (with the help of the marks on the path) where she reports to her family what she has seen. When the bridegroom comes to marry her, she recounts her adventure to her guests as a dream. As proof she shows the severed ring (finger) [H57.2.1]. The robbers are arrested and condemned or killed. (The house of the robbers is destroyed, their treasure is distributed, and the girl marries another man.) Cf. Type 311.",

In the middle of the night the dead man rises from his grave, and asks God for justice. Thereupon a (God’s) voice comes from heaven saying, “30 (40, 50) years from today you will be avenged” [M348]. The young man reports his experience. Know ing that the revenge will take place only after 30 years, the woman agrees to marry him. At the appointed time the couple is invited to dinner in a castle and the prophecy is fulfilled.

On her way she meets a robber. When she tells him her story he leaves her unmolested. When her lover (fiancée) hears about her bridegroom’s (the robber ’s) magnanimity, he takes her back to her bridegroom without touching her [H1552.1]. In some variants the tale occurs in conjunction with a frame tale that deals with the discovery of a thief: Three (four) sons inherit jew el ry (money) from their father (merchants bury their fortune). The money is stolen by one of the brothers (merchants). The robbed own ers call a wise man (judge, king, Solomon), who is to discover the thief. The wise man (his daughter) then starts to tell the story (see above). The thief betrays himself unconsciously when he an swers the question, “Who acted in the noblest way?” He argues that the robber in the story was the most noble one (he answers other ques tions in a revealing manner) [J1177].

A one-eyed man (woman) states that the youth’s father had taken the other eye and demands compensation. The same with a one-legged man, who states that the youth’s father had once taken his other leg and now asks for compensation. A barber agrees to shave the young man for “something” and then demands a huge sum of money (other valuables). Finally the young man is rescued from his difficult situation by someone (his wife, another person) who outwits the cheaters and recovers her husband’s lost property. The rescuer demands that the one-eyed man should give up his remaining eye so that he could match it with the other [J1512.2]. In the same way he demands the remaining leg of the one-legged man, in order to compare it with the other one. The rescuer tricks the barber into accepting “something” for his service [cf.

They think about and eventually change their behavior because of the analog ous actions of their own son (daughter). (1) When an aged father is banned from the table and served his meals in a wooden cup by his son and his daughter-in-law, the little grandson starts to build a similar cup for his parents to use when they grow old. Thereupon the couple starts to reflect on their undigni fied behavior. Thinking of their own old age, they bring the old father back to the family table [J121.1]. (Previously Type 980B.) (2) A son gives his father half a blanket (carpet, cape, cloth) to keep warm. Thereupon the little grandson keeps the other half of the blanket and explains that he will save it for his parents for when they are old [J121]. (Previously Type 980A.) (3) An aged father is abandoned by his son in the wilderness (abyss) in a cart (sledge, basket). The grandson keeps it in order to use it in the same way for his parents when they have grown old (cf. Type 981). They reflect on their behavior. (Previously Type 980C.) (4) The ungrateful son drags his old father out of the house by pulling at his hair. At the threshold the father says, “Do not drag me further; I dragged my own father only this far!” [J121.2]. The son reflects on his bad behavior. (Previously Type 980C.)",

The brother is placed on a chair over a pit filled with red-hot coals, with four lances pointing at him and a sword (stone, millstone) suspended over his head on horse’s hair (thread). The king explains that this situation resembles his own: the pit stands for the fire in hell, the lances for death and the sword signifies the divine judge. This is the reason for his sadness and fear [F451.5. 4.2, F833.2].",

This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) Left to guard the pigs (cows, horses), a farmhand sells them but sticks their severed tails in the muddy ground. His master pulls the tails out and thinks that the pigs are sunk in the mud (have escaped underground) [K404.1]. (2) A farmhand sells his master ’s sheep and hangs their severed tails (bells) in a tree. He thus makes the master believe that the sheep have been carried away by a strong wind (have escaped into the air, have gone to heaven) [K404.3]. (3) A farmhand (thief) kills one ox and puts its tail in the mouth of another, so that his master (the owner of the ox) thinks one ox has eaten the other [K404.2]. (Previously Type 1525P.)",

A man (together with others) who is traveling (in a forest, in the wilderness) accidentally comes to the cave (hut) of an (one-eyed [F512.1.1, F531.1.1.1]) ogre [G100] living alone (with his mother) and tending sheep. The ogre catches the man and threatens to devour him. The man pretends to be a physician [K1010] and promises to heal the ogre’s eye(s) (the ogre falls asleep). The man heats a metal spear, thrusts it into the ogre’s eye [K1011], and escapes from the blinded ogre by covering himself with a sheepskin [K521.1] or by hiding under the belly of a ram that walks out of the cave [K603]. Cf. Types 953, 1135. In some variants, the ogre later tries to recapture the man by using a magic ring (object) which compels the fugitive to keep calling out,“Here I am” [D1612.2.1]. The man succeeds in escaping from the ogre once more: He cuts off his finger with the ring and throws it into the sea. The ogre goes after the ring and is drowned.",

  "description": "This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A woman (man) sees a tiger (other animal). In order to frighten it, she makes her children cry and then tells them that here is a tiger whose meat they can eat. The tiger, terrified, runs away [K1715.4]. A jackal wants to show the tiger that he had been tricked and insists that they go together back to the woman. The tiger, fearing that the jackal will desert him, insists that he and the jackal be tied together. On seeing the two of them, the woman scolds the jackal for having brought only one tiger instead of two (three, ten) [K1715.2]. The tiger thinks the jackal betrayed it. He flees, dragging the jackal with it. (2) A (weak, old) man (Gypsy) frightens an ogre (dragon, devil, tiger) by cunningly demonstrating his power. The ogre fails in trying to kill the man at night, carries a treasure to his home in order to get rid of him, and flees when supposed flesh of his companions is offer ed to him [K1715]. The ogre returns together with a helper and again is frightened away. In some variants, a weak animal makes a strong one believe that it (its children) eats the flesh of the strong one’s companions.

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 1164A, 1164B, 1164D, and 1862B.) Three main introductions can be distinguished: (1) A man throws his quarrelsome wife into a pit (well, gorge). Later he feels sorry (compassionate) and he wants to get her out. But instead of her, he pulls up a devil (demon) who lives in the pit and cannot endure the evil woman either. (2) A devil marries (wants to marry) a young woman and is tricked by his mother-in-law into a bottle (box). A hunter sets him free. (Previously Type 1164A.) (3) (Belfagor.) Souls in hell complain about bad women on earth. The devil(s) wants to test what it is like to live with a wife. In some variants, a man prefers to endure the torments of hell rather than live with his evil wife [T251.1.2.1]. The devil comes to an agreement with him: If the devil cannot live with the man’s wife for a certain time, the man may leave hell [T251.1.2.2]. The devil marries (lives with) an evil woman (widow) whom he wants to get rid of quickly. He gets help from a man (farmer, farmhand). (Previously Type 1164B.) The tale is usually continued by an agreement between the grateful devil and the man who helped him: A (rich) person (princess) is possessed by the devil. Twice the devil allows the helper to expel him from the possessed person, and the helper is given a big reward [K1955.6]. The third time, the devil refuses to leave the possessed per son. The helper threatens the devil with the evil woman (his wife, mother-in-law). The devil flees [K2325]. (Previously Types 1164D, 1862B.) Cf. Type 332.",

When the leaves have fallen, the devil again claims his compensa tion, but God tells him that there is a big oak in Constantinople which still has its leaves. The devil searches for this tree for months. When he comes back, he sees that all the oaks are in leaf again. Boil ing with rage, the devil puts out the goats’ eyes and replaces them with his own eyes. (2) God and the devil argue about the division of power. God wants to rule during the time when the trees are in leaf, the devil at other times. A wren who witnesses this contract makes some of the trees to keep their withered leaves until spring comes, and the devil gives up. (3) The devil helps a man to perform a task (by giving him money ). In return, the man is to come into the devil’s power when the last leaf falls from the (oak) tree. It never falls [K222].

(2) A miser, whose treasure has been stolen, is advised to imagine that it is still intact; he will thus get as much pleasure from it as before [J1061.4]. (Previously Type 1305B.) (3) A miser, wishing to take his gold to the grave with him, orders it to be melted so that he can drink it. Molten butter is substituted, and the miser is duped. (Previously Type 1305C.) Cf. Type 760A*. (4) Even in grave danger or on his deathbed, the miser thinks about how to make or save money. (5) A miser is robbed while lying on his sick-bed, or his hoard is found after his death.",

His wife finds the mirror, takes it up, and sees her reflection. She thinks there is another young woman in it, feels jealous and starts quarreling with her husband. A nun who passes by takes up the mirror and says that the woman in the mirror has become a nun (their old mother sees her reflection in the mirror and tells them that there is only an old woman). (More people look into the mirror and are astonished. Finally the mirror is broken. Or, the real nature of the mirror is discovered.) (2) A foolish son sees his own reflection in the water of the well and mistakes it for a thief. He calls his mother to have a look.

  "description": "(Including the previous Type 1684A*.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Two (male or female) farmers (merchants, master and farmhand) stay overnight at an inn (in a train compartment). When one of them wants to open the window in the morning, he instead opens the door of a cupboard (opens the window but does not realize that the window shutters are still closed). He says that it is still dark outside (and the weather is smelling of cheese) and goes on sleeping throughout the day (three days). Cf. Type 1293C*. In some variants, the travelers sleep in an alcove and cannot find the door. (2) A stupid man (several men) is locked in a dark room for sev eral days. He is made to believe that it is continuous night [J2332]. Various reasons are given for this trick: A man wants to get rid of his brother who has been visiting him for too long, or whose unfashion able clothing embarasses him. A father wants to prevent his two sons from going to a party and spending money unneces sarily. People in the city want to stop farmers from going to market to sell their animals. Servants at a hotel want to make fun of one of their guests. Often the victim is a villager who gets the idea that nights in a town must be longer than those in the country.

He said a spell (prayer) so that the in habitants would stay asleep. Then he let himself into the house by sliding down a ray of moonlight and stole what he wanted. The thief on the roof copies this and says the spell. The man and his wife snore loudly, pretending to be asleep. When the thief tries to slide down the ray of moonlight into the house, he falls and breaks his leg. He is beaten (hanged) [K1054].",

He sees her (through a window) feasting in the company of her lover. When the husband comes home unexpectedly, he tells the trav eler he would invite him in if he could offer him decent food. When the wife pretends that there is no food in the house, the traveler (with the help of a bird or magic implement) pretends to use magic to produce the (hidden) food leftover from the feast. He uses pretended magic a second time to raise the devil (ac tually the hidden lover) and chase him away. The lover and the wife or the host give the traveler a generous reward. Often the husband buys the magic object from him. Cf. Types 1535, 1725.",

The young man confirms the husband’s suspicions, and is pardoned on the condition that he breaks off the relationship. Soon after, however, the merchant notices that the affair is still going on. In order to put an end to it, one morning he orders his wife to go to mass instead of him. As she leaves, she slams the door hard to signal to the young man that it was she and not her husband who went out. The young man wakes up late, believes that the husband has left, and goes to the wife’s bed, where he finds the merchant. The merchant insults him and beats him (castrates him) [K1561].",

When the mother leaves the room, the second student moves the cradle, so that when she comes back she mistakes his bed for hers and him for her husband. When the first student tries to go back to his own bed, he too is con fused by the position of the cradle. He gets into bed with the father and, thinking that this is his friend, tells him what he has done. The father becomes angry and starts to beat the student. When the mother turns on the light, her lover puts the cradle back and moves his friend into their original bed. When she realizes what has hap pened, she tells her husband that they were visited by a demon. The students leave the following morning [K1345].",

He takes along two (more) horses (symbols of masculinity) and many eggs (nuts, hens, other symbols of femi ninity, agricultural products that belong to the female sphere of work). Wherever a husband rules the house, the traveler gives him a horse, and wherever a wife is the master, she receives an egg. There is a great demand for eggs [T252.1]. Finally the traveler finds a man who claims to be master. When this man chooses a horse, his wife contradicts him and he has to settle for an egg. (2) A ham is offered as a price to any man who does not regret his marriage vow during the following year (and a day), or who can prove that he is not afraid of his wife. (3) A piece of bacon is hung at the city gate with a written mes sage: “It will go to whichever husband will swear that his wife does not dominate him”. The farmer who claims the bacon refuses to hide it under his smock, because he is afraid of what his wife will say if he gets marks from the fat on his Sunday coat. (4) A priest asks all the men who consider themselves to be masters of their house to sing the song “Christ is Risen”. All the men are silent and all the women (only one man) sing. Or the priest sings the song by himself. The next year, even he is silent, because now he has a housekeeper.",

The fathers of the rejected women accuse him of slandering their daughters. They are tested again with the stick: the vagina of the first admits that it was unchaste. The second woman stuffs her va gina with hemp, but her anus speaks. The third silences her vagina and anus, but her ear admits to having had premarital intercourse.",

Afraid that she may have to work, the wife follows him secretly and hides. She calls out, “If anyone cuts wood for a reel, he (his wife) will die”. [K1971.4.1]. The man is frightened and goes back home without the wood. (3) A wife tells her husband that the thread she had spun has turned into hemp (has burned, was lost) through his negligence [J2325]: He should make sure that no birds fly over the house while she winds the thread. If they do, the thread will turn into shreds (be burned up). Or, when the thread is transported in a sack, the spin dles disappear (the thread turns into shreds). Cf. Type 1370B*.",

Or, the husband (son) is unable to work outside. His wife (moth er) must do the outdoor work for him, while he does the housework. Often, the wife gives her husband instructions about what work he should do. He does not pay attention and wastes half the day resting. The man tries to do several chores at once, and does everything wrong so that he suffers a series of accidents, e.g. he leans over the well while he is carrying the butterchurn on his back, so that the cream falls into the water (previously Type 1408A), he lets wine or beer run out of the cask and throws flour on top of it to dry the floor [J2176.1] (cf. Type 1387), he lets the cow graze on the roof [J2132.2] (cf. Type 1210), bathes the baby in boiling water [J2465.4] (cf. Type 1013), or demands that the pots walk home by themselves [J1881.1.3] (cf.

She makes sure that the two of them fall to the ground (she falls off the donkey) and her lover lands on top of her (sees under her skirt). At the trial, she swears honestly that no one except her husband and the pilgrim (driver) has ever lain on top of her (has ever seen her naked).

The wife tells her lover not to worry and to wait in the garden, and goes quickly to her husband. He suspects something is amiss and asks where the servant is. She suggests he should wear women’s clothes and go and look for him. The husband does so and finds the servant in the garden. The servant slaps him and tells him that a woman should not cheat on her hus- band. The husband is reassured and rewards the servant for his good morals [K1510]. (2) When her husband comes home suddenly, a wife quickly hides her lover in a chest [K1521.2] (featherbed, cupboard, suitcase). A betraying part of his body (clothing) hangs out, and she manages to warn him indirectly to pull it in. Later he escapes. (Previously 1419K*.) Cf. Types 1419A–H, and 1419J*.",

As they imagine this wealth, they destroy what they already have [J2060, J2060.1, J2061, J2061.1.1, J2061.2, J2061.1, J2061.1.2]. (2) A person (poor man, hunter, Gypsy, married couple) dreams of having a valuable possession (catch from hunting, etc.), which he then tries to obtain. His efforts fail because he imagines his success (e.g. the hunter is so excited that he frightens his prey). (3) A married couple (other people) imagine that they will obtain the means to achieve future wealth, but they disagree about how to manage it. One wants to keep reinvesting the future profits, while the other wants to enjoy part of the wealth.",

The old woman gives her female dog nothing to eat for two days, and on the third day gives it food cooked with mustard (pepper), which makes its eyes water. The old woman (often disguised as a nun or dervish [K1837]) takes this “weeping” dog with her to visit the wife whom the young man loves. When the wife asks what is the matter with the dog, the old woman at first does not reply. Then she tells the wife that the dog is actually her daughter (sister), who turn ed into an animal because she did not reciprocate a man’s love. The young wife believes this false story and asks the old woman to ar range a meeting for her with the young man [K1351]. The go-between cannot find the lovesick young man but does not want to lose her payment for arranging the meeting. She meets a man (who happens to be the husband, returning home) and offers him an assignation. When the wife recognizes her husband, she berates him and accuses him of adulterous intentions. She pretends to have set up the situation as a test. Thus she is exonerated, her hus band is made to seem to be an adulterer, and the old woman loses her payment.",

  "description": "A good-for-nothing young man from a poor family learns the craft of stealing and comes home as a master thief. He (his father) boasts about his skill in front of the earl (godfather) [K301.1, F660.1, H915], who demands (usually) three tests [H1151]. (1) The master thief steals a horse (dog) out of a closely-guarded stall [H1151.2]. He disguises himself as an old woman (beggar) and gives liquor (a drug) to the farmhands (guards, soldiers) to make them sleep [K332]. (2) He steals the bedcover (shirt) and wedding ring of the earl’s wife [H1151.3, H1151.4]. He contrives that the earl shoots a corpse (straw man) and goes to bury the body. The thief tells the earl’s wife that the earl needs the blanket and ring for the corpse [K362.2]. (3) He traps the priest and the sexton in a sack (cf. Type 1737) and puts candles on the backs of crabs. The men take him for an angel and the lights for wandering souls (cf. Type 1740). He carries the sack to the goose house (hangs it in the bell tower or chimney). Cf. Type 1737. After these tests, the master thief is banished from the country (pardoned, rewarded). Cf. Type 328.",

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 1525H, 1525H 1–1525H 3, and 1525N.) Thieves (robbers) test their expertise through a contest in which they steal from each other [K306]. Or a new member of a band of robbers has to demonstrate his skill and outdoes his teacher [L142.1]. Cf. Type 700. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) One thief steals an egg out of a bird’s nest without disturbing the bird. A second thief steals the same egg from the breast (pants pocket) of the first, or steals the trousers (shoe soles) off him while he climbs up to get the egg. Or the first thief takes off his cloth in order to get the egg, and the second thief steals the cloth. (Previously Type 1525H1.) Cf. Type 653. (2) Two thieves steal a ham (butchered hog, goat) from the wife of a former member of their band. This man steals the ham from them, and finally they steal it back again [K306.1]. (Previously Type 1525H2, 1525H3.) (3) Two thieves trick each other. First, they exchange supposedly valuable sacks which turn out to contain only worthless things (sand, hay, etc.) [J1516]. Next, they exchange jobs (tending an un manageable cow, carrying water in a leaky pot, etc.) because each thinks the other ’s work is easier, and both come to grief [J2431.1, K1687]. Together they find (steal) a treasure and each tries to trick the other out of his share. One hides in a chest, and the other, be lieving it to be full of gold, carries it home [K307.1].

This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) An uncle and his nephew (grandfather and grandson, group of thieves) steal an ox (sheep) and roast it. The nephew (apprentice thief) wants to keep all the meat for himself. He takes the hide to a waterhole. Hiding in the bushes, he beats the hide as if he himself were being beaten. He cries and shouts that it was not he but his uncle who stole the ox. The uncle thinks that the boy has been caught, so he runs away [K335.1.3]. In some variants the thieves cut the tail (head) off the ox (sheep) and stick it in the mouth (backside) of another, so that it looks as if one ox has eaten the other. Or they put the severed part in a swamp [K404.1]. When the owner swims out to get his drowned animal, they steal his clothes. Cf. Type 1004. (2) A boy (woman) tells a passing thief (soldier) that he has lost a silver cup (pail, etc.) in the well (river), and asks him to get it back for him. The thief takes off his clothes, climbs in the well, and finds nothing. When he comes back up, he finds that his clothes have been stolen [K345.2].",

  "description": "A clever thief (student, beggar, traveling monk) steals a donkey (horse, mule, ox, cow) that had been tied up (to a tree or hedge, behind a wagon) or saddled or yoked. He leaves his companion in place of the stolen animal. The companion convinces the owner (farmer, minister, pilgrim) that he had been turned into the animal as a punishment for his sins (for cursing his father or moth er). The period of his punishment is now over and he has become human again [K403]. The owner of the animal believes this and lets him go free (and often apologizes for having beaten or insulted him, and gives him hospitality or money). The owner goes to buy a new donkey at the market, where he finds his old animal. Believing that this is his acquaintance, the owner reproaches him for having sinned again, and refuses to buy the animal.",

  "description": "A clergyman, a sexton, and a schoolmaster (three students) want to divide a roasted pig (a pig’s head) among themselves. The criterion for the division is their skill in quoting Scripture. The minister cuts off an ear and says, “So Peter cut off an ear from the servant of the high priest”. The sexton cuts the head off the pig (the second ear) and says, “So was the head of John the Baptist cut off” (“and they gave him a box on the ear”). The schoolmaster considers for a long time. Finally he spreads a cloth and puts the rest of the pig (head) on it and says, “And then they took the holy body away”. [J1242.1]. In some variants, three monks find a single egg and agree that it should go to the one who gives the most appropriate quote from the Bible. The first says, “Purify it from the shell of falsehood”. The second says, “Sprinkle it with the salt of wisdom”. The third says, “Come in to praise the Lord!” and eats the egg. Cf. Type 1626.",

The owner sues him. The poor man flees into a house and frightens (hits) a pregnant woman so that she miscarries. Or a woman invites him in out of the rain, and he sits on her sofa and accidentally kills her child. Her husband (the woman) sues him as well. Out of desperation, the poor man jumps from a high tower (bridge ) and kills a passer-by [N320, N330], whose brother (other relative) sues him. The injured parties bring the poor man before a judge. The judge decides as follows [J1173]: The poor man should keep the borrowed horse until its tail grows back. He should impregnate the mother with another child (and her husband should hit her again, to give her another miscarriage). Her husband rejects this settlement and withdraws his suit. (In some variants, he has to pay a fine to the poor man.) The brother (other relative) of the killed man should jump from the tower upon the poor man in order to kill him. He also with draws his suit. (In some variants he also has to pay a fine to the poor man.) (The poor man leaves with the horse and his settlements.) Some variants have a frame tale: The judge persuades a baker (mer chant) to give him a goose (duck) that belongs to someone else. He promises to protect him if the owner of the goose accuses him of theft. Then as above. Cf. Types 926C.",

A thief tries to break into a house at night but is killed when the wall collapses (he puts his eye out on a projecting stick). The householder is called before the king and sentenced to death (to have his eye put out). The householder, however, blames the mason who built the wall who, in turn, blames the man who supplied the mor tar, etc., until finally one man is found who is too stupid to find some one else to blame. He is condemned to death [J2233]. The owner explains that he needs both his eyes for his work, but his neighbor, who is a hunter, needs only one. The hunter says he really needs both eyes, but his neighbor, who is a musician, always closes his eyes when he plays, etc. The king decrees that one of his eyes be put out. Cf. Type 978. The condemned man is too thin to fit the stake (noose). The dis- ciple is chosen to be executed in his place [N178.2]. The holy man returns and announces that he has discovered that the next man to be executed will go directly to heaven [K841.1, J1189.3]. The king leaps upon the stake himself [K842.4, K843]. Cf.

They invite all the villagers to a big dinner. The family waits in vain for a return invitation from the guests. (2) A rich man kills his poor brother ’s only horse, and gives him its skin. Main part: The poor man goes to the city to sell the cowhide (oxhide, horsehide). During the night he discovers the innkeeper ’s wife with her lover and threatens to expose them. They bribe him not to tell. Or, a merchant believes that the poor man’s sacks of refuse contain valuables. The merchant takes the sacks, and in return leaves his goods for the poor man. Back at home, the poor man tells his rich brother (the villagers) that he received all the money for the animal hide (the refuse). The brother (villagers) kills all his cattle in order to sell their hides, and im poverishes himself (tries to sell refuse and is beaten). In some variants the rich man is angry and tries to kill his brother, but instead he kills an old relative (dead man) who is lying in his place in bed. The poor man takes the corpse away, and con vinces an innocent man that he killed the person. This man bribes the poor man not to tell. Then the poor man claims that he had sold the corpse. Cf. Types 1536C, 1537. The rich man kills all his relatives, hoping to sell their corpses. He is put in prison and set free after he serves his sentence. Still angry, he tries to drown his brother. The poor brother, confined in a sack (chest), finds a passer-by (shepherd, rich lord) who is willing to trade places with him. After this person has been thrown into the water, the poor man comes back to the village with the sheep (horse, riches) and claims he found them under the water. The jealous rich man (the villagers) jumps into the water and drowns. Cf. Types 1539, 1737.",

The woman confirms the rich man’s suspicion and cries out (curses , makes noise). The poor brother opens the chest, strangles the woman (kills her in some other way), and puts some food (cheese, meat, sausage, bread) in her mouth. The rich brother opens the chest, sees that the woman is dead, and thinks she has suffocated. He wants to keep her death secret and bribes the poor brother not to tell any one and to bury her. Later, the poor brother digs her up at night (keeping some of her valuables) and sets her body at his brother ’s door, where it falls over when the door is opened in the morning. The rich brother thinks the corpse has returned to haunt him [K2151, K2321]. Cf. Type 1537. He pays his poor brother more money to bury the corpse again (often three or four times), but it turns up in the barn, close to the well, on a foal that follows the rich man, etc. The poor man gets so much money (cattle, provisions) for reburying the body that he becomes as rich as (richer than) his brother.",

(One of the three hunch backed brothers marries a rich widow, and his poor brothers visit her uninvited.) The husband unexpectedly comes home. The musicians hide in a chest (oven, cellar), where they die [N320] (kill each other). (2) Three monks (clergymen, knights, students) court a beautiful woman. On the advice of her husband, she invites them to visit her. The visit of the first lover is interrupted by that of the second, etc., and they hide in a chest (oven, cellar). The third lover hides when the husband arrives. The husband kills them in their hiding place [K1551.1]. Cf. Type 1730. A drunken man (stupid farmhand, farmer, porter, undertaker, beggar, soldier, the devil) is employed to dump one of the dead bodies into the river (to bury it). When he returns, he finds the second body in the same place as if it had come back from the dead, and then the third. After he gets rid of all three bodies, he meets the hunch backed husband (another monk, clergyman, knight) and, think ing that this is another revenant, kills him and dumps him into the river (buries him) also.

This “murderer” puts the body into a sack and throws it into the river. Fishermen find it and hang it in a shop (put it in a boat or on a sledge, or tie it on a horse and drive it into a field or into a crockery shop), and the shop keeper “kills”’ it again [K2151]. Cf. Type 1536C. Often the trickster (the first murderer) blackmails the subsequent “murderers” for not exposing their “murders”. Cf. Type 1536A.",

(In vari ants from southern and eastern Europe, the farmer is persuaded to cut off the animal’s horns, ears, and tail in order to get a better price.) The farmer pays in advance at three inns and invites the students to eat with him. Instead of paying, he turns his hat around three times (hits it on the table, throws it on the floor, rings a bell), and the innkeeper says that the bill has been settled. The students buy the hat for a high price. When they try to use it, they discover the trick [K111.2]. (Variants from central Europe end here.) When the students come back for revenge, the farmer pretends to be dead. His wife (occasionally the students) revives him with a stick [K113.4]. (Or, the farmer ties a skin filled with blood under his wife’s clothes and pretends to kill her.) He revives her with a “magic wand” (flute, violin, knife), which he sells to the students. The students kill their wives (mothers) but cannot revive them. They put the farmer into a sack (cask) to be drowned, but he trades places with a herdsman who comes by. By pretending to have found the herd of cattle on the bottom of the sea, the farmer induces his greedy adversaries to jump into the water. Cf. Type 1535. In variants from southern and eastern Europe, after the intro duction in which the animal is mutilated, the farmer puts coins in the anus of his donkey (horse, cow) or mixes them with its dung. He sells the animal as a gold-producer [K111.1] (and says that the animal must remain in its stall for two weeks or forty days. The animal dies.). In some versions, the farmer sells his adversaries supposedly wonderful objects, e.g. a messenger rabbit [K131.1], a pot that cooks by itself [K112.1], a pick that locates gold, a rifle that always hits its mark, or a self-propelled sled. Or the farmer promises to teach them to speak Latin and cuts their tongues off [K1068.2]. Some variants end with the farmer buried alive. When his adver saries come to rob the grave, he brands them [K911.1] or cuts off their genitals (noses).",

  "description": "A master (landlord) makes up a pretext to send a boy (a farmer) who has offended him to the wine cellar, where the servant is supposed to give him a beating. When the boy sees the servant, he pulls the bung out of the wine cask so that the servant has to use his thumb to close it up. The boy beats him up and runs away, taking bacon (sausage), bread, and a jug of wine with him. Cf. Type 921D*. In some variants, a guest tries to cheat an innkeeper (leaves without paying his bill) who has boasted to him that such a thing had never happened to her. He tells her that he can draw both red and white (any kind of) wine from the same cask. He bores two holes in one cask and tells her to stop them with her thumbs while he goes upstairs to get a glass (some glasses). He leaves and does not come back, so the innkeeper has to wait until her husband comes to rescue her.",

  "description": "This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A poor man (soldier, youth) prays to a saint’s picture for a certain amount of money, promising to give back double that amount at the end of a month. The sexton overhears and, hoping for the large repayment, gives the poor man what he asked for. The sexton claims to be the messenger of the saint, but the poor man refuses to repay the money to him [K464]. (2) A poor man (journeyman, farmhand, sexton, trickster) asks God (a saint) for a certain sum of money, no more and no less. A rich man (master, gentleman, priest, Jew) tests him by giving him (as a joke) 99 (999) instead of 100 (1000) (gold) coins. The poor man ac cepts them, saying, “Whoever gave me these will surely give me the last one too”, (he counts the value of the purse as the missing coin, adds a coin of his own). He refuses to pay back the money and makes blasphemous excuses (God is old and forgetful, or He cannot count) [J1473.1]. Often the tale continues: The lender goes to a judge in order to force the poor man to repay his money. Before the case is tried, the poor man tricks the lender out of his overcoat, shoes, and often his horse. Even the judge is tricked by the poor man, who makes the lender so suspicious that the judge thinks he must be insane. (Cf. Types 1525L, 1642A.) On his way home, the poor man meets someone who says he is the Son of God. The poor man demands that he give him the missing coin which his father had overlooked.",

The doctor treats him with three capsules filled with feces (puts dung in his mouth). The first restores his sense of taste, after the second, he is able to speak the truth, and when he takes the third, he proves that his memory is good. In some variants, a clever doctor heals a patient by diverting his attention. For example, in a Jewish variant a king has an inflamed eye because he touches it all the time. The doctor tells him that he is pregnant and will give birth in nine months. The king begins to worry about his stomach and touches it: Thus his eye is able to heal. When the birth does not take place, the doctor explains his trick and is made court physician.",

The clergyman calls the wife’s and daughter ’s vaginas prisons, and the youth pretends to be innocent and not to know what they are for. Through other tricks (e.g. using ambiguous names; cf. Type 1545), he seduces the sexually-naive wife and daughter in the presence of the clergyman [K1327]. For example, in a Russian variant, one night the farmhand tells his employer that he has caught a thief (which is his penis) who should be sent to prison. In the presence of the unsuspecting clergy man, he sends the “thief” into the prisons of the wife and daughter. When he realizes what has happened, the clergyman gets angry and curses the farmhand, thus losing an expensive wager (cf. Type 1000), and has to let him go free.",

He threatens that if it is not returned immediately, he will do what his father would have done in these circumstances. The bystanders are horrified and give him a new horse (the thief returns his horse). They ask the man what it was his father would have done. He replies, “He would have walked” (have bought a new saddle). In oriental variants, the man’s shoes are stolen, and the man says his father would have bought new shoes. (2) Two travelers (horsemen, teamsters) meet on the road and neither will give way to the other. One of them threatens that if the other does not let him pass, he will do to him what he did the day before to another man who was in his way. The other traveler lets him pass, and asks what it was he had done the day before. He replies that he had let the man pass [K1771.2]. Cf. Type 202. (3) A beggar (dervish, Gypsy) threatens the inhabitants of a village (a single person) that if they do not give him some particular thing, he will do to them what he did to the people in another village (what his father did in the same situation, something he does not want to have to do). They give him what he wants but ask what he meant by his threat. He explains, he had to go on without the thing (had to work). (4) A lazy student (night watchman) asks his father for money (asks for more pay). He threatens that if his request is not granted, he will have to do something that he does not want to have to do. The answer to the question is, he will have to study (work for his same wages) [K1771.3].",

  "title": "Agreement Not to Scratch",
  "description": "This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) A man (trickster) continually scratches his head or body (because of a disease) (he sneezes continually). He is promised a reward if he can refrain from scratching (sneezing) for a certain length of time. When he can no longer resist the itching, he tells a story (calls out) in which he can make gestures or sounds that permit him to scratch (sneeze) [K263]. Sometimes the listeners realize what he has done, but they reward him anyway because they admire his cleverness. (2) A bald (mangy) man (with head lice), a man who scratches him self, and a man with a dripping nose agree (are ordered, often by the king) not to touch themselves. All of them manage to break the pro hibition by telling stories which they illustrate with their forbidden movements. For example, the bald man says that his father bought him a fur cap, and he mimics putting it on and taking it off. The scratching man says his father bought him clothes, and touches himself to show where they did not fit. The man with the dripping nose calls them both liars and points at them by rubbing his nose twice with his fingers. (3) A god offers a prize (his daughter, an ox, both) to whichever animal can clear a field of nettles without scratching himself. After other animals try and fail, a certain animal (spider, Brer Rabbit) wins the prize by disguising his scratching in his animated description of the ox. (4) Two men (a Jew and a Russian) agree not to scratch. Each tries to make the other break the agreement. For example, the Jew sprinkles pepper in the Russian’s shirt, and the Russian puts lice in the Jew’s trousers. When the Russian can resist no longer, he says that his uncle received medals from the czar, which he wore “here and here and here”, thus scratching those places. The Jew replies that his uncle received so many medals that he had to put them in his trousers’ pocket and feel around for them – which he demon strates.",

He announces, “What God has joined together, let no man put asunder”. The hungry apprentices plan revenge. They tell a customer that their master does good work but his temper is unpredictable: he often strikes the table with his fist and then falls in a rage. Before the tailor cuts the cloth, he hits the table to make the shears bounce so he can hear where they are and find them. The customer thinks the tailor is going to attack him and defends himself by grabbing the tailor around the neck and fighting. The tailor calls his apprentices to help, but they answer, “What God has joined together, let no man put asunder”.",

When his wife asks what he is doing, he replies he did not want to get out of practice. (Previously Type 1574B.) (3) A stingy woman has the tailor come to her own house so that he will not be able to steal her cloth. The tailor cuts a piece and throws it out of the window, saying, “That is the devil’s piece”.

The tale concludes with an explanation of local property ownership (a warning against false testimony). (2) Through laziness (criminal activities, etc.), a man (Eulen - spiegel) falls out of the favor of his king (master). As punishment (to get rid of him), he is banished. The man comes back in a cart with foreign soil (foreign dirt in his shoes) and thus cleverly avoids his punishment [J1161.3].

Cf. Type 1807A. (2) A thief (soldier, Gypsy) goes into a house to steal bacon (suit). When the owner hears a noise, he comes and finds the thief with the bacon.

He goes out into the world and finds something (cheese, bird) which he puts into his pocket. He meets a giant who challenges him to prove his strength. The giant squeezes water out of a stone, and the tailor matches him by squeezing his cheese [K62] (cf. Type 1060). The giant throws a stone high into the air and the tailor throws his bird [K18.3] (cf. Type 1062). The giant orders the tailor to help him carry a tree out of the forest, so the tailor takes the top end and rides in the branches [K71] (cf. Type 1052). Using various tricks, he accomplishes other feats ([K1112] cf. Type 1051; [K63] cf. Type 1061; [K18.2] cf. Type 1063; [K72] cf. Type 1082; [K61] cf. Type 1085; [K525.1] cf. Type 1115). The tailor goes to the king’s palace. The king promises the tailor his daughter in marriage and half the kingdom if he can accomplish several tasks: vanquishing two giants [K1082], catching a unicorn (the animal runs into a tree with its horn, and cannot get free) [K771], and catching a wild boar (he drives it into a church) [K731]. The tailor uses tricks to accomplish the tasks. After the tailor marries the princess, he accidentally (by speaking of needle and thread, or in his sleep) discloses his humble origin [H38.2.1]. The king sends his soldiers to take back the tailor ’s king- dom. The tailor pretends to be asleep and brags about his heroic deeds [K1951.3]. The soldiers flee in fear [K1951.2], and the tailor keeps his kingdom.",

This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Each son takes his inheritance to a foreign country where it is unknown and sells it there for a fortune [N411]. A king buys the rooster because he thinks that it makes the sun rise. Fools who had used awls to harvest their grain pay generously for the scythe (cf. Types 1202, 1203, and 1203A) [N411.2]. The cat is sold at a high price in a country plagued by rats where cats were unknown (cf. Types 1281, 1651). Or, the inhabitants flee because they are afraid that the cat will devour everything, not just the rats. (2) The brothers turn their inheritance into riches by some other means. For example, the millstone falls down onto robbers who are counting their treasure; the robbers flee leaving the money behind (cf. Type 1653). Or, one brother who has inherited a rope uses it by the shore to make sandals. The devil comes out of the water and asks what he is doing, and he replies that he is making a trap for the devil (to tie the lake together). The devil offers him gold in exchange for the rope (cf. Type 1045). Or, one of the brother inherits a musical instrument (fiddle) that makes wolves dance. He is given money when he threatens to let the enchanted wolves go free (to call them back) (cf. Type 1652).",

  "description": "A youth (man, merchant, poor woman) buys a cat and gives it to a merchant (gentleman) to take away on his ship (caravan) and sell (the owner himself takes it on a journey). The cat is taken to a country (island, Africa, India) where there are no cats. This country is so overrun with mice (rats, snakes) that the inhabi tants cannot sleep for fear of being bitten; or, while eating, they have to defend themselves from the animals’ attacks with cudgels and hammers. The man demonstrates the cat’s ability to hunt and sells it for a high price. (The cat returns to him twice, so he is able to sell it three times .) The merchant intends not to give the money to the cat’s owner , but a storm (miracle) convinces him to be honest. The young man who was the cat’s original owner marries the merchant’s daughter (a princess in the foreign land) [N411.1]. Cf. Types 1281, 1650.",

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 1653A–F.) This tale exists chiefly in five different forms: (1) Travelers (a single traveler) in need of a place to spend the night climb a tree. While they are hidden in the branches, robbers (rich people) settle under the tree to count their booty (to have a feast). The people in the tree overhear the activity below and let some thing (e.g. a door, cf. Type 1009) fall (accidentally). It lands on the robbers, frightening them so that they flee and leave their valuables behind. The travelers keep the booty and thus become rich [K335.1.1]. Cf. Types 1009, 1650, and 1875. (2) On leaving home, a husband tells his wife (wife tells her husband, mother tells her son) to mind (shut or lock) the door, but instead she takes it with her [K1413]. At night they climb a tree. The door falls, frightening robbers who flee and leave their booty behind [K335.1.1.1]. (3) Two (more) brothers exclude their youngest brother from their thieving expeditions because they think he is a fool. In order to get his own wealth, he climbs a tree, taking a door (corpse, mill stone) along with him. He lets it fall on robbers who have gathered under the tree. They run away, leaving their booty behind [K335.1.1.1, K335.1.2.1]. (Previously Types 1653B and 1653C.) Cf. Types 326B*, 1525R. (4) A person in a tree drops part of a dead animal (head, in testines, hide) on rich people (robbers) who are enjoying a feast under the tree [K335.1.1.2]. (Previously Types 1653D and 1653E.) (5) Robbers overhear a foolish man (woman) talking to himself. The robbers misinterpret the words, think they have been discover ed, and flee, leaving their booty behind [K335.1, N611, N611.2, N612].

The follow ing episodes are the most common: (1) Left alone at home, the fool is instructed to put a certain ingredient (e.g. parsley) in the food he is cooking. He puts the dog (cat) that is named Parsley into the soup [J2462.1]. (2) The fool is told to clean a certain area. He takes this order literally and throws out everything that is in it [J2465.5]. (3) When he goes courting, he is advised to cast eyes at the girl. He puts out the eyes of animals (often sheep) and throws them at her [J2462.2]. In some cases, the metaphoric meaning of the gesture is understood; in others, the young woman rejects the foolish suitor [J2462.2]. Cf. Type 1006. Additional episodes come from the following groups of types: 1000–1029, 1200–1349, 1350–1439, 1525–1539, 1640–1674, and 1675– 1724. In some versions, the protagonist is a stupid son-in-law.

He (she) cries for help, but no one understands; the cry is taken to be part of the song and is thus repeated by the group [J2417.1]. Often the leader ’s foot is broken before the wagon is stop ped. In a Berber variant, a teacher from the city is supposed to teach prayers from the Koran to men in the mountains. They stand out side and repeat the words of the prayers after him. The teacher bows to the ground and touches a board, which he is using to protect himself from the mud, with his forehead. His nose becomes wedged in the board. The teacher calls for help, but the companions take this for part of the prayer and repeat the words zealously. The teacher tears his nose away, leaving the tip behind. He tells the companions they must first learn Arabic, and departs. Cf. Types 1246, 1825D*, and 1832M*.",

Similarly, he asks other people in turn the name of the husband of a beautiful woman, of the winner of the lottery, or the owner of a ship. He is amazed at the wealth of Mr. “I Cannot Understand You”. He becomes reconciled to his own modest circumstances when, as he follows a funeral procession, he learns that Mr. “I Cannot Understand You” has died [J2496]. Cf. Types 314, 1545, and 1699.",

This cures him of his alcoholism [X811].) Cf. Types 1313A*, 1531. In some versions the drinker is uncurable. When his wife, disguised as a ghost, brings him food, he tells her, “If you had known me better you would have brought me drink”. The wife ca pitu lates [J1323].",

The servant pretends that he is supposed to do some job that threatens the lover ’s hiding place: light the oven, clean the chimney, clean the wool. He is about to throw a chest in which the lover is hiding into water or to throw it down the stairs (he lets the lover free in return for a ransom). The lover hides in the calf ’s stall and the servant drives him out with a whip. The wife wants to bring food outdoors to her lover, whose whereabouts she thinks she can locate by following certain signs along the way. The servant manages to alter the signs (e.g. he puts cloth on a horse to change its color) so that the wife brings the food to him instead [K1571]. The wife sends the servant to take food to her lover (to invite him to a meal). The servant drops the food on the way and tells the lover that the husband has discovered the adultery. On his way back, he tells the farmer that the lover has refused to come. Or, he says that the lover wants the farmer to help him repair his broken plow [K1573]. When the lover sees the farmer collecting the food strewn along the way, he thinks he is coming with the tools or going to attack him, so he runs away. Meanwhile, the servant has told the wife that her husband knows about her adultery, so she runs away. He tells the farmer that she left because her village (house) burned down. Or that she had promised always to cook food just as good as she did today if her husband can catch up with her. The farmer immediately goes after her. (Cf. Type 1741.) In the end, the wife confesses and she (and her lover) are possibly punished [K1572]. Cf. Types 1358, 1358A–1358C.",

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 1738A* and 1738C*.) Three main versions of this story can be distinguished: (1) A priest refuses to go to the deathbed of one of his parish ioners to perform the last rites, because the man has not come to church (for another reason). The sick man recovers and meets the priest. He tells him that he dreamed (that it really happened) that he died and went to the gate of heaven. St. Peter would not let him in because he had not received the last rites. The sick man had asked if he could not receive them postumously in heaven. Peter explained that there are no priests in heaven: they are all in hell [X438]. Often continued by Type 1860A. Also told of other professions (e.g. lawyers, commissioners of police), ethnic groups (e.g. Scots, Jews), and rich people (noblemen). (2) A fool comes down a hill. The clergyman asks him where he comes from. He answers, “From above”. The clergyman asks him what God is doing up there [H797.2]. The fool answers, “He is wondering why there are so few clergymen in heaven”. Cf. Types 922, 1833C. (Previously Type 1738A*.) (3) In order to enter heaven, a clergyman and a sexton are re quired to make a chalk mark for each of their sins on the stairs. The clergyman has to go back and get more chalk. Cf. Type 1848. (Previ ously Type 1738C*.)",

The man asks if his place in heaven is guaranteed. The clergyman replies, “Nearly”. (He has his hand on the doorknob to heaven, the fire in purgatory is only as high as his knees.) The dying man (his rela tives) says that he can take care of himself from here. (2) An old woman asks a clergyman whether her deceased hus band is in heaven or in hell. He asks for a donation and she gives him some money. After a while the clergyman tells her that her hus band is still burning in hell (up to his knee) and she should give more money to save him. The old woman refuses, saying that her hus band always had cold feet. Or, an old woman asks the clergyman if it is warm enough in heaven , or if she would be better off in hell.

(2) Master and servant (clergyman and sexton) go hunting (in the forest). The servant brings food but the master does not. When they become hungry, the servant eats his food privately and tells the master that he is eating hay (horse droppings). In the evening they are tired when they come to a farm. The servant warns his master not to accept an invitation to eat when it is first offered. He also tells the farmer not to invite the master more than once, or he will be come angry. The master declines the first invitation, and it is not repeated. During the night, he goes out in search of food, and gives the servant the end of a rope to hold. The servant ties his end of the rope to the innkeeper ’s bed, which motivates the next part of the tale. Main part: The hungry man eats his fill and wants to take some food to his companion. He winds up in the host’s bed and thinks the backside of the housewife is his companion’s face. When she farts, he thinks his companion is blowing on the food to cool it. Angry that the “man” will not eat, he slaps the porridge into his “face”. The woman wakes up and thinks she has soiled the bed [X431]. In some variants, the tale continues: The guest washes his messy hands in a jug and cannot get them out. Intending to break the jug on a stone, he breaks it instead on the bald head of the host or on the buttocks of the host’s wife, who has gotten up to clean herself.",

The page there is blank. The clergyman begins his sermon with the words, “From nothing, God created the heavens and the earth”. Some times he ends there. More often, the sermon that follows is con sidered a particularly good one. (2) A congregation complains that their clergyman, often a layman, knows no Latin. He goes to the sexton for advice. As they walk around, the sexton tells him some mock-Latin words which he makes by adding endings onto familiar words. The clergyman copies this formula in his next sermon, and the congregation is appeased [K1961.1.2]. Cf. Type 1628*.

The sexton suggests to the clergyman that a shoemaker (tailor, beggar) who happens to look like the statue should stand in its place. The shoemaker agrees. Before the end of the service, however, he has to move (he sneezes or has to urinate, is bothered by insects, burns his foot on a candle). Often he curses. The statue’s coming to life is said to be a miracle. (2) A woodcarver who is supposed to carve a saint’s statue does not finish it on time. He finds someone who looks like the statue to take its place. A representative from the church comes and asks the woodcarver to alter the statue with a knife. The person taking its place becomes frightened and runs away. Cf. Types 1347, 1359C, 1572A*, and 1730.",

He refuses to do so because he is certain that the Holy Ghost is not such a spend thrift. Asked how many persons constitute the Holy Trinity and who they are, a boy answers, “Four”.

(2) A clergyman reverses the number of loaves and people by mistake. Someone in the audience says that he could do that too. The following year, the clergyman gets it right and asks the congregation if they could do that. Someone says yes, because there would be leftovers from the previous year. (3) A clergyman says that God made the world in six months. He is corrected by the congregation but sticks to what he had said. (4) In variants from eastern Europe, a clergyman says that God made Adam out of clay and put him on a fence to dry. Someone in the congregation asks where the fence came from, since no one was there to have made it.",

Ex amples: (1) When Diogenes sees children drinking from their cupped hands, he gives up his own drinking cup. (2) A servant of the king sees Diogenes eating cabbage (washing lettuce) and says, “If you worked for my master, you would have better things to eat”. Diogenes answers, “If you would eat cabbage, you would not have to flatter your master”. [J211.1]. Cf. Type 201.",

  "description": "A boy (man, girl, woman) becomes lost (has run away from home or from his master, etc.). (In the forest,) he meets robbers (thieves, Gypsies, Indians) who put him into a cask. A wolf (fox, dog, bear) comes to eat the robbers’ leftovers (sniffs at the cask). The boy reaches out through a hole and seizes the animal by its tail (so that it cries out). It runs away dragging the cask behind it until the cask breaks. Often the boy discovers that he has been taken back home. (The animal loses its tail or is killed.) [X1133.3]. Cf. Types 1229, 1653, 1900. There is a northern group of variants in which a cabin boy annoys the crew with his pranks (bad work, stupid conversation) or is blamed for a dangerous storm. The sailors throw him into the water in a cask along with some provisions (including honey) and tools. When he comes to a shore, he bores a hole and smears it with honey. Thus he lures a bear (fox, cow) and seizes its tail.",

  "description": "During a very cold night in May, someone tells a man that long ago there was an even colder night. He goes on a journey to learn more about it. He meets an otter that has been lying on a rock in his cave for so long that his body has worn out the rock. The otter has heard of the cold night, but it was before his time. He sends the man to an eagle who has been sitting for so long on an anvil that the anvil is worn off away from the whetting of his beak on it. The eagle sends the man to an one-eyed salmon who remembers the cold night. As he was jumping out of the water, it froze beneath him, and he landed on the ice. After a bird came and picked his eye out, the salmon’s blood thawed the ice and he was able to swim again [B841, B124.1, X1620].",

When the turnip is cut open, the sow is found inside with seven piglets (seven cartloads of hares are found inside). Fifteen men uproot the turnip using levers, and two horses are needed to move it. A boat is made from its rind. The cabbage (mushroom) is so big that an entire regiment of soldiers fits under its leaves (cap). Part of it is used to make soup for a battallion, but the rest of the vegetable is still too big to pass through the lock of the canal. Six men work for six weeks to dig up the potato, but they excavate only its top half. A stalk of rye is so fat that a hog can go through it, or a man can drive a horse and wagon through the stalk and turn around inside it. Five men can stand on its stump. One grain is so big that just cut ting it in two yields a bucket of sawdust. The tobacco is so tall that, to prune it, nine ladders have to be stack ed one on top of the other. It takes two men a whole day to cut out both sides of the stalk. Standing on the stump they fight for two days over the tobacco. Cf. Type 1920A.",

The following are the most common variants: A building is so tall that when an axe falls from the peak of the roof, a swallow is able to build her nest in it, lay her eggs, and rear her young, before the axe hits the floor. A barn is so long that when a cow is taken to the bull at the other end, she gives birth to her calf before she gets back to her stall. A church is so big that when a baby is baptized, he is old enough for his first communion before he comes out. A room is so big that, for three years, the father and mother look for each other inside it. On his way to his morning coffee, the farmer has to stop twice for meals. From the middle of the room the walls are not visible, so people have to use the floorboards to orient themselves. Everything on the farmstead is enormous: buildings, animals, fields, tools, plants, catch of fish, oven, containers, cooking implements, pipes, people, and cattle. The cows give so much milk that it flows out of the stall like an ocean, and someone in a boat has to float on it to skim the cream, etc.",

A rooster goes to get water for the hen to drink, but the water sends him to get red silk from a bride first. The bride sends him to get a wreath, etc. Or, the rooster asks for help from various animals (pig, cow, etc.), people (miller, baker, shoemaker, etc.), and/or objects (river, tree, etc.) [Z32.1.1]. When the rooster comes back with the water, the hen is already dead. All the animals participate in the funeral procession [Z32.1]. At the end, a flea (fly, mouse) falls and is crushed under the wagon’s wheel. (Previously Type 2021A.) Cf. Type 285. The rooster buries the hen [B257] and then dies from grief. (The hen who had been choking is bumped and the nut becomes dis lodged from her throat.)",

  "description": "(Including the previous Types 2027, 2027A, and 2028A*.) A cat (wolf, troll, mouse, giant, bear, chick, pump kin, woman, louse) with a huge appetite drinks a great quantity of milk, then eats a lot of food and devours the family with whom he lives. He goes out and people (animals) whom he meets on the road ask him why he is so fat (where he is going, why he is out so early). The cat lists everything he has eaten and announces that he will eat this person too. He devours everything he meets, e.g. certain animals, a cowherd, a flock of birds, a driver and his team of horses, etc. [Z33.2, Z33.3, Z33.4]. At the end, the cat bursts or meets an ox (someone else) he wants to eat which splits the cat’s belly open with its horn (a knife). Everything that the cat had eaten comes out alive. Cf. Types 123, 333. In some variants, a childless couple use clay to make a child who eats everything he meets.",

This miscellaneous type consists of various chain tales in which a person (animal) wants an animal (person, object) to do something (go home, pick pears, grow, get some beer, eat, reap grain). The animal refuses. The person threatens him by asking someone else (person, ani mal, object, or element: e.g. dog, stick, fire, water, butcher) for help. The request is not granted (the help is postponed until some de mand can be met). Finally someone (hangman, angel of death, ani mal) obliges, and all the others in succession do what the person had wanted them to [Z41, Z41.3, Z41.4, Z41.4.1, Z41.4.2, Z41.7, Z41.7.1, Z41.8, Z41.9]. In a few variants, a mouse eats cheese (wheat, wick of an eternal flame). A cat condemns the mouse and eats it as punishment; a dog eats the cat for eating the mouse. Each animal, object, or element is blamed for having damaged the one before it, and is then punished [Z41.1]. (Previously Type 2030C.)",
